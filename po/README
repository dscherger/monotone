This file should give you some basic information
to start on a new translation for monotone.

You should meet the following prerequisites:

a) You've pulled and checked out net.venge.monotone
b) You have a text editor with UTF-8 support
c) You can deal with the shell...

Now the step-by-step HOWTO:

I) Create a new, untranslated po-file for your language
  
   $ cd /path/to/net.venge.monotone/po
   $ ./po-update.sh <yourlang>
   
   where <yourlang> is the ISO 639-1 code of your language
   (e.g. "en" for English, "de" for German, aso.)
   
   If the language differs by region, you can also
   expand the code with the country code to reflect these
   differences. F.e. "en_GB" stands for English as spoken
   (and written) in Great Britain (BE), while "en_US" 
   determines American English (AE).

II) Add your language to the LINGUAS list by creating an
    entry in a new line in this file
    
III) Edit the header of your new language po according to
     the excellent HOWTO here [0]. Of particular interest
     are mainly two things:
     
     a) The encoding of the file (Content-Type: ...)
        Set this to the encoding you'll use in your text
        editor to translate the file. UTF-8 is recommended
        here.
     b) The Plural forms configuration (Plural-Forms: ...)
        The Entries here differ from language to language,
        some might have more complex plural forms (e.g.
        Slavic languages), others have simple ones (e.g.
        most Romanian languages). If you don't know exactly
        what to write here, take a look at the gettext manual
        here [1].
        
Thats it basically. If you like to have a nice GUI for editing
language files, I can recommend KBabel[2], which already comes 
with the kdesdk module.

Subsequent calls to po-update.sh backup the old po file
as "<langcode>.po.old". If new strings are recognized, the
script will tell you with "XX untranslated messages". If
existing strings have changed, you'll get a message similar
to "XX fuzzy messages".
