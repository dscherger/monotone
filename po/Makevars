# xgettext configuration for Monotone.

# These options get passed to xgettext.  Note that some of the options
# are given twice, once in each variable.  In fact, our configure
# script defines XGETTEXT_OPTIONS=$(XGETTEXT_OPTIONS_NO_FLAG) if it
# discovers that the version of xgettext available does not support
# --flag.  It would be cleaner to do something else -- have these in
# the configure script, or have on variable with the --keywords and
# one with the --flags and combine them at configure time, or
# something -- but we cannot.  XGETTEXT_OPTIONS _must_ literally be
# defined to contain the best set of xgettext options, because
# intltool-update reads this file and scans for XGETTEXT_OPTIONS
# directly.  Also, intltool-update doesn't seem to grok line
# continuations, so XGETTEXT_OPTIONS needs to fit all one one line.
# So... be careful if touching this stuff.
