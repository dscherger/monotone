AT_SETUP([restricted commit with inodeprints])

MTN_SETUP

# this test is a bug report. the problem is that inodeprints tries to update its
# cache for all files in the complete manifest, but a restricted commit can
# succeed with missing files if they are excluded. subsequently the inodeprint
# update fails because it can't build a complete manifest due to the missing
# files.

# one solution is to let inodeprints update its cache only for files that are
# included in the restriction, which seems to be safe. the only gaurentee that
# inodeprints mode makes is that if a file's current inodeprint matches its
# cached inodprint then it has not changed. i.e. for a missing file, the cache
# would not be updated but the old cached value can't possibly equal the current
# value since the file does not exist and cannot have an inodeprint.

# also, it may be a useful feature (?) to allow refresh_inodeprints to update
# its cache for a restricted set of files by allowing paths on the command line
# to establish a restriction.
