HOWTO make tests
================

Quick and dirty howto, to get you up to create and run tests.
Very early draft. Feel free to improve.

Running tests:
--------------
-  Starting in the monotone main dir. After having './configure'd monotone you 
   can do 'make testsuite' to create 'testsuite'. Running './testsuite' will
   run all tests.
-  'testsuite -l' lists the names and numbers of all available tests
-  'testsuite <n>' runs only test number n
-  option -v will show the command outputs
-  option -d will keep the testsuite.dir files for post-test debugging
-  option -h is your friend :)

Creating tests:
---------------
-  Copy and paste is your friend :)
-  TODO: need more here...
-  Remember to add a line at the end of testsuite.at


Template for a test (name t_<testname>.at
-------------------

AT_SETUP([brief test description goes here])
MONOTONE_SETUP

#the next lines (including AT_XFAIL_IF) state that the test is
#expected to fail as this is still a bug. Remove if it should pass!
# This test is a bug report. It is expected to fail
AT_XFAIL_IF(true)

#AT_CHECK executes a shell command, second argument is the error
#return code we expect, third argument is the output we expect from
#stdout. use ignore if you don't care about the output. If oyu use
#stdout all following commands can use file 'stdout' for further
#processing. Same goes with 'stderr' as the last argument
#see autoconf tutorials
#e.g. http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.57/
#     html_node/autoconf_167.html for further information.
