# This test is a bug report.
AT_XFAIL_IF(true)

# Actually, we don't have a reduced test case for this, but this test
# can serve as a marker until someone tracks this down and makes one.

# The bug is that if, on the main monotone repo, you run
#   $ mtn lca e3623ca77d2a8b45817ecaa5b67018c453652830 7d5918d0181f7bb9adba2ee63234146d23bcf83e
# (note that one is in branch net.venge.monotone, one in
# net.venge.monotone.cvssync, for finding them in monotone-viz) the
# output is ce860bae312c4bb8483d5b3b2a8cd3bebe2323d5, even though the
# real lca is 0b17415d7aa112060e8ead9ae7a486510dc61a9d.
