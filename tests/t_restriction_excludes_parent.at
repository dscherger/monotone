# - restricting a new project excludes the root directory addition
# - restricting to things below a newly added directory excludes the directory
# - excluding added directories but including things they contain is bad
#
# we should issue a nice error indicating that such a restriction must
# be expanded to include the containing directories.
# we should also provide some way to include only these directories and not
# all of their contents. 
#
# --depth=0 should probably mean "directory without contents" rather than
# "directory and all immediate children"
