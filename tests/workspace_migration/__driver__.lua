-- This test ensures that 'mtn workspace_migrate' can take any old-format
-- workspace and move it forward to the current time; it is basically a
-- compatibility test (see also the 'schema_migration' test).
--
-- This means that every time the workspace format is changed, you need to add
-- a new piece to this test, for the new format.  The way you do this is to
-- run this test with the -d option, like so:
--   $ ./testsuite.lua -d workspace_migration
-- this will cause the test to leave behind its temporary files.
-- Copy all the directories named 
--   tester_dir/workspace_migration/<thing>-current/
-- to this directory, rename them <thing>-<old format version>, and update
-- the 'current_workspace_format' variable at the top of this file.

-- If the workspace format change added possibilities to what the
-- workspace can represent, you may need to write a new workspace set,
-- which goes in its own little lua file.  Pick a <thing>, name the
-- file <thing>.lua, and add <thing> to the workspace_sets array below.
-- The file should return a table with three entries.  
--
-- 'creator' is a function of no arguments that creates a live
-- workspace named '<thing>-current' which makes use of the new
-- feature.  If it needs to make commits, it should do so only on
-- branches whose name begins with <thing>.
--
-- 'min_format' is the minimum workspace format version that can
-- represent the workspace you construct in 'creator'.
--
-- 'checker' is a function that takes two workspace directories as an
-- argument, verifies that the first one still has any interesting
-- properties given it by 'creator', and that (to the maximum extent
-- possible) those properties are consistent with the same properties
-- held by the second directory.
--
-- It should not be necessary to modify the creator function after it
-- is written; the checker function may well need updating for future
-- workspace structures.  Note that the code in this file does a
-- certain amount of common work setting up and checking the
-- workspaces; do not duplicate that work in creators or checkers.
