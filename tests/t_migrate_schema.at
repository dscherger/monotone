# This test is a "bug report" -- the bug is that there is no test that
# tests schema migration!  The way to do this is probably to create a
# standard database with some revisions, files, certs, keys, and stick
# in here uuencoded versions of it for each database format we want to
# test.  Then migrate each old format database with 'db migrate', and
# test that we can read the new database, and that it has the contents
# that it's supposed to.  (Including things like actual content of the
# files.)
