-- This tests a somewhat subtle version of how public keys are handled
-- with netsync.  The rule is, we serve a key if we're serving any cert
-- signed by that key.  The question is, if when we boot up the server
-- we already have the key in question, but it isn't signing any such
-- certs, but _then we get pushed such a cert_, do we push out the key
-- on further netsyncs?

-- We create a key in database 2, read the public key into database 1,
-- then start database 1 serving.  Then we push a cert into database 1
-- signed by the key, and we pull into database 3.
