AT_SETUP([branch handling in disapprove])
MTN_SETUP

# 1) if no --branch is specified, disapprove should use the branch
#    cert on the rev being disapproved.  if there are multiple such
#    certs, it should fail.  the working copy's branch (if any) is
#    irrelevant.
# 2) if --branch is specified, dispprove should use the branch given,
#    and ignore the branch cert on the rev being disapproved.

# This test is a bug report.
AT_XFAIL_IF(true)

# From reading the disapprove code; this is obviously broken.  I don't
# have time to write a real test right now.  So this is a todo to even
# write the bug report...
