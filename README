make symlinks
	Set up a couple of symlinks
make usher
	Modified usher that uses the project database for a server list,
	and uses the same config file as the web interface.

skel/		Some useful files

www/		Make this accessible to your webserver
www/viewmtn/	viewmtn install, modified slightly

projects/*/	Project-specific (internal)
www/projects/*/	Project-specific (web-available)
graphs/		viewmtn graph cache
		These three need to be +rw for the webserver.
		Also, the webserver needs to be able to symlink from
		www/projects/ to www/{project.php,admin.php,viewmtn/}.
		This probably means that those have to be owned by the
		webserver, since apache likes to only follow symlinks
		that are owned by the same user as the target file.

hostconfig	config file
common.php	$conffile must point to the hostconfig file

Make sure all dns addresses *.<hostname> map to an address that the
usher is listening on.

usher hostconfig
	There's a modified usher that uses the same config file and
	takes the server list from a database
