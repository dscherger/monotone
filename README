monotone GUI projects
=====================

this is a scratch space for working on potential GUI tools
for monotone. it has the following directories:

  - polytony/

    this is nathaniel smith's early work which shows a queryable ancestry
    graph of a given database. it has its own instructions.

  - lattice/

    this is graydon hoare's later, less complete but more MVC-ish
    work which shows a multi-pane view of things; it is intended
    to incorporate some of polytone's code in the ancestry pane,
    and (hopefully) to grow into a "standard" GUI for monotone.

  - flipview/

    this is some work zack weinberg did in this area, for viewing
    RCS files. it might or might not be of interest in developing
    the "file" view in lattice.
