The public_html directory should correspond to what you find at
http://venge.net/monotone/

I put it in a subdirectory so that stuff like this README and scripts
to auto-upload changes to the website, etc.., could be checked into
the same project without the hassle of figuring out which should get
uploaded.

Initially got files doing 'wget -r --exclude-directories=/downloads
http://venge.net/monotone/', but for some reason that wasn't actually
excluding the downloads directory.  Not sure what's up with that.
