Monotone::AutomateStdio version 0.1
===================================

This is a Perl library module for accessing Monotone's automate stdio
interface. Monotone is a distributed, change-set, based SCM system. It has a
mode where commands can be sent to it via STDIN and output read from it via
STDOUT. Monontone::AutomateStdio makes use of this facility to provide the Perl
programmer with a programmatic interface to Monotone.

For further details on Monotone see http://monotone.ca.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To install to a custom location use:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<Custom Full Path Name>

Please note that automated testing of this library module is still `work in
progress'. There is a test harness called mtn-tester that can be used to test
most important features of this library. However, it does require not only the
installation of Monotone, as you would expect, but also a test database with
certain revisions and files in it. At the moment this is done by using a
dedicated branch in the main Monotone database found at monotone.ca. The test
branch is called net.venge.monotone.contrib.lib.automate-stdio.test.

In time I hope to write a Monotone emulator that generates the required output
to test the library, or perhaps just have a smaller database generated on the
fly.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Perl 5.8.5

Older versions of Perl may work but these have not been tested at this point in
time.
