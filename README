mtn-browse Version 0.60
=======================

mtn-browse is an application for browsing Monotone VCS databases without the
need of a workspace. The interface allows one to:

    * Easily select a revision from within a branch.
    * Find a revision using complex queries.
    * Navigate the contents of a revision using a built in file manager.
    * Display file contents, either using the internal viewer or an external
      helper application.
    * Compare the changes between different revisions or versions of a file
      either using the internal difference viewer or an external application.
    * Find files within a revision based on detailed search criteria.
    * Display file annotations and easily refer back to the corresponding
      change documentation.
    * Save files to disk.

INSTALLATION
------------

Using linux-install
-------------------

As root simply unpack the tar file and run the installer by doing:

    tar xvpzf mtn-browse-<Version Number>.tgz
    cd mtn-browse-<Version Number>
    chmod +x linux-install
    ./linux-install -i

and then follow the prompts.

If you wish to do an automated install then all of the options can be specified
on the command line. To get more information on what options are available do:

    ./linux-install --man

In particular, package maintainers may find the following particularly useful:

    ./linux-install --prefix=/opt/mtn-browse --destdir=/tmp/install-dir

This tells the installer to configure the installation as if it were going
under /opt/mtn-browse but actually installs it under /tmp/install-dir (i.e. the
application can be found at /tmp/install-dir/opt/mtn-browse/bin/mtn-browse).

Manual Installation
-------------------

If you prefer to install this application manually then copy the files into
place using the following directory structure:

    <Install Location>
    |-- bin
    |   `-- mtn-browse
    `-- lib
        `-- mtn-browse
            |-- perl
            |   |-- AdvancedFind.pm
            |   |-- Annotate.pm
            |   |-- ChangeLog.pm
            |   |-- ComboAutoCompletion.pm
            |   |-- Common.pm
            |   |-- Completion.pm
            |   |-- FindFiles.pm
            |   |-- FindText.pm
            |   |-- Globals.pm
            |   |-- History.pm
            |   |-- Monotone               <- 1)
            |   |   |-- AutomateStdio.pm
            |   |   `-- AutomateStdio.pod
            |   |-- Preferences.pm
            |   `-- WindowManager.pm
            `-- ui
                |-- annotate.png
                |-- diffs.png
                |-- external-diffs.png
                |-- line.png
                |-- monotone-viz.png
                |-- mtn-browse-large.png
                |-- mtn-browse.glade
                `-- mtn-browse.png

The only file that needs to be executable is the mtn-browse file under the bin
directory.

Once the files are in place then edit the mtn-browse executable and change the
constants at the top containing the "@INST:LIB_DIR@", "@INST:GLOBS_FILE@" and
"@INST:PREFIX_DIR@" values so that they contain the correct values. It is
probably best that you actually run the installer as a non-privileged user and
install it somewhere under your home directory and then change the paths
accordingly.

1) The Monotone directory is only needed if the Monotone::AutomateStdio package
   from CPAN has not already been installed.


DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    * Perl 5.8.5 or later
    * Gnome and Gtk2
    * The following Perl CPAN modules:
          - Glib (1.144) *
          - Gnome2 (1.042) *
          - Gnome2-Canvas (1.002) *
          - Gnome2-Print (1.000) *
          - Gnome2-VFS (1.080) *
          - Gtk2 (1.146) *
          - Gtk2-GladeXML (1.006) *
          - Gtk2-SourceView (1.000) *
          - libintl-perl (1.16)
          - Monotone::AutomateStdio

Please note that the Gtk2 CPAN bundle will probably satisfy all of the
dependencies marked with * at the end of the line.

Older versions of Perl may work but these have not been tested at this point in
time.
