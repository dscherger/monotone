README for Monotone plain
=========================

The monotone plain (or "dumb") protocol allows two-way synchronization via sftp or plain files, and one-way (pull) via http(s) and ftp.

Prerequisites:
 python 2.4 
 the urlgrabber module (http://linux.duke.edu/projects/urlgrabber)

Syntax:






NOTES:

The monotone plain protocol always involves three entities:
 a (local) monotone database
 a local transit merkle-directory
 a (possibly remote) merkle-directory to sync with
The sync directories are called merkle-directories because essentially contain a two-level merkle trie plus a datafile with the revision data.

All synchronization is done between the two merkle-directories: the monotone database interacts only with the transit merkle-directory.

CONFIGURATION
-------------------------

Configuration is stored in ini-like file. Configuration file can be changed using '--config' option, default is
$HOME/.mtnplain (USERPROFILE is used instead of HOME if it's not existent - win32).

If "-s|--storeconfig" option is specified then command line settings (repository, local dir etc.) are stored
in config file for future use. WARNING this option rewrites current config file.

All options that are configurable by command line can be configured in file. Configuration is
readed from sections [default] and [DATABASEPATH] in this order. As a result effective precedence of
options is:
 - command line options
 - [DATABASEPATH] section of config file
 - [default] section of config file
 - hardcoded defaults

Example configuration:
------- .mtnplain
[default]
verbose = 1
rsakey = /home/zbigg/id_rsa 

[d:/repo/monotone-dumb.mtn]
verbose = 0
repository = "dws://zzagorski.strony.wi.ps.pl/mtdumb/index.php:monotone-plain/"
local = file:C:\DOCUME~1\zbigg\USTAWI~1\Temp\_d_\repo\monotone-dumb.mtn-mtndumbtemp

[d:/repo/xxx.mtn]
rsakey = /home/zbigg/id_rsa_other
