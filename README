createdb <dbname>
psql -f schema.sql <dbname>
	setup database, if not done as the webserver user, that user will need
	permission to read/insert/update.
	If you want the reset script to work, you need permission to delete.
cp hostconfig.dist hostconfig
	and then update to match your local setup

skel/		Some useful files

www/		Make this accessible to your webserver
www/viewmtn/	viewmtn install, modified slightly

projects/*/	Project-specific (internal)
www/projects/*/	Project-specific (web-available)
graphs/		viewmtn graph cache
		These three need to be +rw for the webserver.
		Also, the webserver needs to be able to symlink from
		www/projects/ to www/{project.php,admin.php,viewmtn/}.
		This probably means that those have to be owned by the
		webserver, since apache likes to only follow symlinks
		that are owned by the same user as the target file.

hostconfig	config file
common.php	$conffile must point to the hostconfig file

Make sure all dns addresses *.<hostname> map to an address that the
usher is listening on.

usher hostconfig
	There's a modified usher that uses the same config file and
	takes the server list from a database
