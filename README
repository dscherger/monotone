`monotone' is a free distributed version control system that provides
a simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully
disconnected operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization
protocol.  It understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight
branches, integrated code review and 3rd party testing. it uses
cryptographic version naming and client-side RSA certificates.  It
has good internationalization support, few external dependencies,
and runs on unix, OSX, windows, and is licensed under the GNU GPL

that helps us enhance `monotone' further, or simply fix problems on
machines we don't have, or in code we don't use often.  Please send
bugs reports to the mailing list monotone-devel@nongnu.org, or
