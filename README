mtn-browse Version 0.62
=======================

mtn-browse is an application for browsing Monotone VCS databases without the
need of a workspace. The interface allows one to:

    * Easily select a revision from within a branch.
    * Find a revision using complex queries.
    * Navigate the contents of a revision using a built in file manager.
    * Display file contents, either using the internal viewer or an external
      helper application.
    * Compare the changes between different revisions or versions of a file
      either using the internal difference viewer or an external application.
    * Find files within a revision based on detailed search criteria.
    * Display file annotations and easily refer back to the corresponding
      change documentation.
    * Save files to disk.

DEPENDENCIES
------------

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    * Perl 5.8.5 or later
    * Gnome and Gtk2
    * The following Perl CPAN modules:
          - Glib (1.144) *
          - Gnome2 (1.040) *
          - Gnome2-Canvas (1.002) *
          - Gnome2-Print (0.950) *
          - Gnome2-VFS (1.080) *
          - Gtk2 (1.146) *
          - Gtk2-GladeXML (1.006) *
          - Gtk2-SourceView (1.000) *
          - libintl-perl (1.16)
          - Monotone::AutomateStdio (0.05 or later)

Please note that the Gtk2 CPAN bundle will probably satisfy all of the
dependencies marked with * at the end of the line.

Older versions of Perl may work but these have not been tested at this point in
time.

Monotone::AutomateStdio Library
-------------------------------

This library module is a Perl interface to Monotone's automate stdio interface
and is heavily used by mtn-browse. As such it is probably best to upgrade this
library each time you upgrade Monotone itself. For this reason you may decide
to just install this library as a part of mtn-browse. If you need to upgrade
the library then all you need do is just copy the new version into place.

The installation process will, by default, install a copy of this library in
mtn-browse's lib directory.


INSTALLATION
------------

Using Makefile.PL
-----------------

Simply unpack the tar file and use Makefile.PL by doing:

    tar xvpzf mtn-browse-<Version Number>.tgz
    cd mtn-browse-<Version Number>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

To install to a custom location use:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<PATH>

To configure the software to run in a custom location but have the installation
location prepended by an additional path (useful for package maintainers) use:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<PATH> DESTDIR=<PATH>

Those of you familiar with CPAN will recognise the above as the standard
mechanism for installing Perl modules (or libraries). However, there does not
seem to be a standard way of installing a Perl application. Since Perl is
largely platform independent, the ./configure; make; make install approach of
automake does not seem right. So I have decided to write a custom Makefile.PL
script that supports some basic installation capability.

In fact Makefile.PL simply calls the installer script, passing any arguments
through to it. The installer script supports some additional options that can
also be specified via Makefile.PL, meaning that the full list of arguments are:

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<PATH> DESTDIR=<PATH> LIBDIR=<PATH> \
                     GLOBS_FILE=<PATH> HELP_VIEWER=<PATH> NO_USE_DISTS_MAS=1

For further information on what these options mean please run:

    ./linux-installer -m

PREFIX equates to --prefix, DESTDIR equates to --destdir, LIBDIR equates to
--libdir, GLOBS_FILE equates to --globs-file, HELP_VIEWER equates to
--help-viewer and NO_USE_DISTS_MAS equates to --no-use-dists-mas.

Alternatively one can run the installer directly. See the next subsection.

Using linux-installer
---------------------

As root simply unpack the tar file and run the installer by doing:

    tar xvpzf mtn-browse-<Version Number>.tgz
    cd mtn-browse-<Version Number>
    chmod +x linux-installer
    ./linux-installer -i

and then follow the prompts.

If you wish to do an automated install then all of the options can be specified
on the command line. To get more information on what options are available do:

    ./linux-installer --man

In particular, package maintainers may find the following useful:

    ./linux-installer --prefix=/opt/mtn-browse --destdir=/tmp/install-dir

This tells the installer to configure the installation as if it were going
under /opt/mtn-browse but actually installs it under /tmp/install-dir (i.e. the
application can be found at /tmp/install-dir/opt/mtn-browse/bin/mtn-browse).
