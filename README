README for Monotone plain
=========================

The monotone plain (or "dumb") protocol allows two-way synchronization via sftp or plain files, and one-way (pull) via http(s) and ftp.

Prerequisites:
 python 2.4 
 the urlgrabber module (http://linux.duke.edu/projects/urlgrabber)

Syntax:






NOTES:

The monotone plain protocol always involves three entities:
 a (local) monotone database
 a local transit merkle-directory
 a (possibly remote) merkle-directory to sync with
The sync directories are called merkle-directories because essentially contain a two-level merkle trie plus a datafile with the revision data.

All synchronization is done between the two merkle-directories: the monotone database interacts only with the transit merkle-directory.
