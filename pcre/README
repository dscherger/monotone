This is the library component of pcre 7.4, downloaded from
<ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre/>.  The only
modification made to the code is that each .c file has been changed to
#include "pcre_config.h" unconditionally, instead of "config.h" only when
HAVE_CONFIG_H is defined.  The file pcre_config.h is an appropriately
customized version of pcre's config.h.in.  (This is done so that we
don't clutter monotone's own config.h with pcre's settings.)  The files
pcresyntax.texi and pcrepattern.texi are translations to Texinfo of the
upstream documentation files pcresyntax.3 and pcrepattern.3, which were
in manpage format.
