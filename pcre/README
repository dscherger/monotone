This is most of pcre 6.7.  Configuration settings have been HARDWIRED.
(pcre does not have any portability constraints that we need to worry
about.)  Unicode support has been removed, and the "dftables.c"
program has been run and its result checked in.  pcre_internal.h has
been modified to include pcre_config.h instead of bare config.h.  Some
#ifdefs have been added to pcre_tables.c, pcre_internal.h, and
pcre_dfa_exec.c to dike out Unicode more thoroughly.
