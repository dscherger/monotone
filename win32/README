To create a MinGW release, the 'make dist' target does not work for
MinGW. Instead, we use Inno Setup. Here are all the steps for
creating a MinGW release, on a fresh Windows machine:

Install MinGW tools; see ../INSTALL, MinGW section

Install a monotone binary; see http://monotone.ca/

Install Inno Setup and Inno Setup preprocessor; see
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php, get the Quick Start Pack ispack-5.3.3.exe

Get a copy of the monotone repository; see
http://wiki.monotone.ca/SelfHostingInfo/

Check out the release version of monotone:
mtn -d /path/to/monotone.db checkout -r t:monotone-<version> monotone-<version>

Build the release. In an MSYS shell:
cd monotone-<version>
autoreconf -i
./configure
make win32-installer

That builds "monotone-<version>-setup.exe" in current folder.

NOTE:
  If ISCC (Inno setup compiler) is not in PATH, what is very probable, then you
  need instruct makefile about it's location:
  
    make win32-installer ISCC=/d/progs/InnoSetup5/ISCC.exe

Publish the binary on the monotone website with proper permissions:

chmod a+r monotone-<version>/win32/monotone-<version>-setup.exe
scp -p monotone-<version>/win32/monotone-<version>-setup.exe mtn-uploads@monotone.ca:~/<version>

Download from the web and test!
