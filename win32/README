To create a MinGW release, the 'make dist' target does not work for
MinGW. Instead, we use Inno Setup. Here are all the steps for
creating a MinGW release, on a fresh Windows machine:

Install MinGW tools, and a monotone binary; see
http://www.venge.net/mtn-wiki/BuildingOnWindows.

Get a copy of the monotone repository; see
http://www.venge.net/mtn-wiki/SelfHostingInfo

Check out the release version of monotone:
mtn -d /path/to/monotone.db checkout -r t:monotone-<version> monotone-<version>

Build the release. In an MSYS shell:
cd monotone-<version>
autoreconf -i
./configure
make

Install Inno Setup; see http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

In Inno Setup, open monotone/win32/monotone.iss

If you have installed MinGW in a non-default place, adjust the Source:
paths to the mingw dlls to match your mingw installation

If you have built monotone in a separate build directory, adjust
the Source: paths to monotone.exe and monotone.html

Choose menu Build | Compile (or click the "compile" button). This
generates monotone-<version>-setup.exe in the monotone/win32
directory.

Publish the binary on the monotone website: TBD
