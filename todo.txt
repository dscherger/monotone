1) Cull by date to show only revisions newer than a certain date. Useful on big graphs, essential on huge ones
2) Cull by file - this is currently broken due to gaps in the log file output ancestory linking. Either query database directly or change log output - this may not be regarded as an error in the log output by some
3) Cleanup legacy code mess in GXLViewer
4) Hotspot for hover and click on revision nodes for changelog, node selection and diff
5) Highlighting for branches on revision nodes
6) Cull by branch/revision
7) Multi-headed graph showing all revisions of all branches
