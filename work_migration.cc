// This file's primary entry point is workspace::migrate_ws_format.  It is
// responsible for migrating workspace directories from metadata formats
// used by older versions of monotone.  This file also defines the other
// workspace:: functions related to metadata format.  Whenever a new
// workspace format is added, this file must be updated and a test must be
// added to tests/workspace_migration/, following the instructions in that
// file.

// Workspace metadata formats have a revision number, which is a simple
// nonnegative integer.  Any given version of monotone supports normal use
// of exactly one format, the "current" format; it also supports 'migrating'
// from all previous formats.  The current metadata format is recorded in
// this constant:
static const unsigned int current_workspace_format = 2;

// This is the oldest released version of monotone that supports the current
// format.
static const char first_version_supporting_current_format[] = "0.30";

// In a workspace, the metadata format's revision number is, notionally,
// stored in the file _MTN/format.  However, this file only appears in
// metadata formats 2 and later.  Format 1 is indicated by the _absence_
// of _MTN/format.  Format 0 is even older, and is indicated by the
// metadata directory being named "MT", not "_MTN".  All these little
// details are handled by the following two functions.  Note that
// write_ws_format is a public interface, but get_ws_format is not
// (the corresponding public interface is check_ws_format, below).
