This is Polytony, an experimental GUI interface to Monotone histories.

There's quite a bit of kluging in it, but I still find it quite useful.
So far it can do (really stupid) layout of ancestry, and then let you
view certs, diff different versions, and checkout particular versions
directly on the graphical representation.  (Try left-clicking and
right-clicking on the nodes.  To diff two nodes, you right click on
one, select "diff", then click on another.  You click them in the
same order you would list them on the command line.  To cancel, just
click on the background.)

The diffing won't work properly unless you have a version of monotone
with my patch to the 'diff' command, which you can get from my depot.

There are a lot of ways it could be improved; see TODO.

To run it, for now do 
   python run.py <path to monotone> <path to monotone db>
in this directory.

You probably need Python 2.3, and you definitely need wxWindows.
I'm using wxGTK+ v2.4.1; not sure which other versions work.
