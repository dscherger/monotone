The master for these figures is the file oo-figures.sxd.

The individual PDFs are generated by loading that file in OpenOffice,
selecting the components that make up a single figure, hitting "File
-> Export as PDF", choosing the filename correponding to the figure
selected, hitting "Export", and then in the second dialog box that
pops up, hitting "Range: Selection", and then "Export" again.

The PNGs are generated from the PDFs.
