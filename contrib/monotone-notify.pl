=head1 NAME

monotone-notify.pl - a script to send monotone change notifications by email

=head1 SYNOPSIS

monotone-notify.pl [--help] [--man]
[--db=database] [--root=path] [--branch=branch ...]
[--[no]update] [--[no]mail] [--[no]attachments] [--[no]ignore-merges]
[--from=email-sender]
[--difflogs-to=email-recipient] [--nodifflogs-to=email-recipient]
[--workdir=path] [--before=yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss] [--since=yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss]
[--quiet] [--debug] [--monotone=path]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<monotone-notify.pl> is used to generate emails containing monotone
change logs for recent changes.  It uses monotone database variables
in the domain 'notify' to keep track of the latest revisions already
logged.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--help>

Print a brief help message and exit.

=item B<--man>

Print the manual page and exit.

=item B<--db>=I<database>

Sets which database to use.  If not given, the database given in
MT/options is used.

=item B<--root>=I<path>

Stop the search for a working copy (containing the F<MT> directory) at
the specified root directory rather than at the physical root of the
filesystem.

=item B<--branch>=I<branch>

Sets a branch that should be checked.  Can be used multiple times to
set several branches.  If not given at all, all available branches are
used.

=item B<--update>

Has B<monotone-notify.pl> update the database variables at the end of
the run.  This is the default unless B<--debug> is given.

=item B<--noupdate>

The inverse of B<--update>.  This is the default when B<--debug> is
given.

=item B<--mail>

Has B<monotone-notify.pl> send the constructed logs as emails.  This
is the default unless B<--debug> is given.

=item B<--nomail>

The inverse of B<--mail>.  This is the default when B<--debug> is
given.

=item B<--attachments>

Add the change summary and the output of 'monotone diff' as
attachments in the emails.  This is the default behavior.

=item B<--noattachments>

Have the change summary and the output of 'monotone diff' in the body
of the email, separated by lines of dashes.

=item B<--ignore-merges>

Do not create difflogs for merges (revisions with more than one
ancestor), if the ancestors are in at least one of the branches that
are monotored.  This is the default behavior.

=item B<--noignore-merges>

Always create difflogs, even for merges.

=item B<--from>=I<from>

Sets the sender address to be used when creating the emails.  There is
no default, so this is a required option.

=item B<--difflogs-to>=I<to>

Sets the recipient address to be used when creating the emails with
logs containing diffs.  This or B<--nodifflogs-to> MUST be used, and
both can be given at the same time (thereby generating two emails for
each log).

=item B<--nodifflogs-to>=I<to>

Sets the recipient address to be used when creating the emails with
logs without diffs.  This or B<--difflogs-to> MUST be used, and both
can be given at the same time (thereby generating two emails for each
log).

=item B<--before>=I<yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss>

Only log revisions where the datetime is less than the one given.

=item B<--since>=I<yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss>

Only log revisions where the datetime is greater or equal to than the
one given.

=item B<--workdir>=I<path>

Sets the working directory to use for temporary files.  This working
directory should be empty to avoid having files overwritten.  When
B<--debug> is used and unless B<--mail> is given, one or both of the
two files F<Notify.debug-diffs> and F<Notify.debug-nodiffs> will be
left in the work directory.

The default working directory is F</var/tmp/monotone_notify.work.$$>,
and will be removed automatically unless F<Notify.debug-diffs> or
F<Notify.debug-nodiffs> are left in it.

=item B<--debug>

Makes B<monotone-notify.pl> go to debug mode.  It means a LOT of extra
output, and also implies B<--noupdate> and B<--nomail> unless
specified differently on the command line.

=item B<--quiet>

Makes B<monotone-notify.pl> really silent.  It will normally produce a
small log of it's activities, but with B<--quiet>, it will only output
error messages.  If B<--debug> was given, B<--quiet> is turned off
unconditionally.

=item B<--monotone>=I<path>

Gives the name or path to monotone or both.  The default is simply
F<monotone>.

=head1 NOTES

You might notice that a series of logs for some branch may span over
other branches.  This is because some development may actually go
through those other branches by virtue of 'monotone propagate' and
other means to move changes from one branch to another.

This behavior isn't entirely deterministic, as it depends on when the
last run of B<monotone-notify.pl> was done, and what head revisions
were active at that time.  It might be seen as a bug, but if
corrected, it might miss out on development that moves entirely to
another branch and moves back later in time, thereby creating a hole
in the branch currently looked at.  This has actually happened in the
development of monotone itself.

For now, it's assumed that a little too much information is better
than (unjust) lack of information.

=head1 BUGS

Fewer than before.
