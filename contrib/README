This directory contains various things that we're not quite sure what
to do with, but that someone may find useful.  See individual files for
licenses.

  -- Log2Gxl.java: Java code to convert output from 'monotone log' into
     GXL, an XML-based graph description language.

  -- monotone-notify.pl: a Perl hack to create email logs with recent
     changes in a repository database.  It's designed to be run at regular
     intervals, for example from a cron script.  It uses database
     variables (those handled with 'monotone set/unset') in the domain
     domain 'notify' to keep track of the last revisions that have
     already been sent out.
     For a manual, do `perl Notify.pl --man'.
     To get a help text, do `perl Notify.pl --help'.

  -- ciabot_monotone.py: A python script to watch a repository and
     send notifications of commits to CIA (http://cia.navi.cx).

  -- monotone.bash_completion: command line completion code for bash.

  -- monotone.el: A basic Emacs interface.
