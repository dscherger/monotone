This directory contains various things that we're not quite sure what
to do with, but that someone may find useful.  See individual files for
licenses.

  -- monotone.bash_completion: command line completion code for bash.
  -- monotone.zsh_completion: command line completion code for zsh.

  -- monotone.el, monotone-nav.el: An Emacs interface.

  -- ciabot_monotone.py: A python script to watch a repository and
     send notifications of commits to CIA (http://cia.navi.cx).

  -- mtbrowse.sh: An interactive text-mode history browser

  -- monotone-notify.pl: a Perl hack to create email logs with recent
     changes in a repository database.  It's designed to be run at regular
     intervals, for example from a cron script.  It uses database
     variables (those handled with 'monotone set/unset') in the domain
     domain 'notify' to keep track of the last revisions that have
     already been sent out.
     For a manual, do `perl Notify.pl --man'.
     To get a help text, do `perl Notify.pl --help'.

  -- monotone-import.pl: a Perl hack to provide an approximate of what
     what 'cvs import' does.  The difference is that you have to decide
     yourself what the import branch is called, and you have to propagate
     the resulting revision to your development branch if you have one.
     For a manual, do `perl monotone-import.pl --man'.
     To get a help text, do `perl monotone-import.pl --help'.

  -- monoprof.sh: A simple monotone profiling script.

  -- Log2Gxl.java: Removed. Now in branch net.venge.monotone.contrib.monotree

  -- mtn_cheat_sheet.svg: A SVG image inspired by Mercurial's QuickStart Guides
     (http://people.type-z.org/seb/mercurial/v1.0/)
