.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B mtn-cleanup
returns a workspace to its pristine state with the minimum of change;
missing files are restored, changed files are reverted and new files
are removed.
.SH "BUGS"
.B mtn-cleanup
doesn't look to see if the database happens to be somewhere in the
workspace, and might therefore remove it.  Future version may take a
look at
.I _MTN/options
to check for this possibility.
