//
// this file defines the vocabulary we speak in when dealing with the
// filesystem.  this is an extremely complex problem by the time one worries
// about normalization, security issues, character sets, and so on;
// furthermore, path manipulation has historically been a performance
// bottleneck in monotone.  so the goal here is the efficient implementation
// of a design that makes it hard or impossible to introduce as many classes
// of bugs as possible.
//
// Our approach is to have three different types of paths:
//   -- system_path
//      this is a path to anywhere in the fs.  it is in native format.  it is
//      always absolute.  when constructed from a string, it interprets the
//      string as being relative to the directory that monotone was run in.
//      (note that this may be different from monotone's current directory, as
//      when run in workspace monotone chdir's to the project root.)
//
//      one can also construct a system_path from one of the below two types
//      of paths.  this is intelligent, in that it knows that these sorts of
//      paths are considered to be relative to the project root.  thus
//        system_path(file_path_internal("foo"))
//      is not, in general, the same as
//        system_path("foo")
//
//   -- file_path
//      this is a path representing a versioned file.  it is always
//      a fully normalized relative path, that does not escape the project
//      root.  it is always relative to the project root.
//      you cannot construct a file_path directly from a string; you must pick
//      a constructor:
//        file_path_internal: use this for strings that come from
//          "monotone-internal" places, e.g. parsing revisions.  this turns on
//          stricter checking -- the string must already be normalized -- and
//          is extremely fast.  such strings are interpreted as being relative
//          to the project root.
//        file_path_external: use this for strings that come from the user.
//          these strings are normalized before being checked, and if there is
//          a problem trigger N() invariants rather than I() invariants.  if in
//          a workspace, such strings are interpreted as being
//          _relative to the user's original directory_.
//          if not in a workspace, strings are treated as referring to some
//          database object directly.
//      file_path's also provide optimized splitting and joining
//      functionality.
//
//   -- bookkeeping_path
//      this is a path representing something in the _MTN/ directory of a
//      workspace.  it has the same format restrictions as a file_path,
//      except instead of being forbidden to point into the _MTN directory, it
//      is _required_ to point into the _MTN directory.  the one constructor is
//      strict, and analogous to file_path_internal.  however, the normal way
//      to construct bookkeeping_path's is to use the global constant
//      'bookkeeping_root', which points to the _MTN directory.  Thus to
//      construct a path pointing to _MTN/options, use:
//          bookkeeping_root / "options"
//
// All path types should always be constructed from utf8-encoded strings.
//
// All path types provide an "operator /" which allows one to construct new
// paths pointing to things underneath a given path.  E.g.,
//     file_path_internal("foo") / "bar" == file_path_internal("foo/bar")
//
// All path types subclass 'any_path', which provides:
//    -- emptyness checking with .empty()
//    -- a method .as_internal(), which returns the utf8-encoded string
//       representing this path for internal use.  for instance, this is the
//       string that should be embedded into the text of revisions.
//    -- a method .as_external(), which returns a std::string suitable for
//       passing to filesystem interface functions.  in practice, this means
//       that it is recoded into an appropriate character set, etc.
//    -- a operator<< for ostreams.  this should always be used when writing
//       out paths for display to the user.  at the moment it just calls one
//       of the above functions, but this is _not_ correct.  there are
//       actually 3 different logical character sets -- internal (utf8),
//       user (locale-specific), and filesystem (locale-specific, except
//       when it's not, i.e., on OS X).  so we need three distinct operations,
//       and you should use the correct one.
//
//       all this means that when you want to print out a path, you usually
//       want to just say:
//           F("my path is %s") % my_path
//       i.e., nothing fancy necessary, for purposes of F() just treat it like
//       it were a string
