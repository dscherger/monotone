Creating A New Translation File
===============================

Copy the mtn-browse.pot file to <Locale>.po, e.g. de.po, and then edit as
appropriate. The installer will convert the po files to mo format and store them
under:

    .../share/locale/<Locale>/LC_MESSAGES/mtn-browse.mo

e.g.

    .../share/locale/de_DE/LC_MESSAGES/mtn-browse.mo


Updating An Existing .PO File With Changes From The Latest .POT File
====================================================================

Unfortunately from time to time there will be changes made to the code that
affect the corresponding .POT file, and so all the .PO files have to be updated
as well.

When you want to update your .po file to contain the latest message strings from
the .POT file, use a command like:

    msgmerge -U <Locale>.po mtn-browse.pot

For example:

    msgmerge -U de.po mtn-browse.pot

This will update de.po with the changes from the new mtn-browse.pot file. The
state of the message entries in the updated file will be one of:

    Translated   - Exact match found, existing translation used.
    Fuzzy        - Close enough to the original to use its old translation but
                   will need some attention.
    Untranslated - No match found, needs a new translation.
    Obsolete     - No longer required, can be deleted.

Emacs has a .PO file mode and has a quite few useful commands to help you. Some
are:

    t/T - Find next/previous translated entry.
    z/Z - Find next/previous fuzzy entry.
    u/U - Find next/previous untranslated entry.
    o/O - Find next/previous obsolete entry.

For more information please see info gettext updating for more information.

Please note that message entries of the form mtnb-.... (for example
mtnb-gsc-menus) are reference labels used by the application to call up specific
sections in the help documentation. If or when you translate the help manual, it
is up to you whether you bother to translate these labels into your native
language (these are never displayed to the user) or leave them alone. Either
way, please make sure that these labels are consistent across the mtn-browse.xml
file and the .PO file.


Thank you.
