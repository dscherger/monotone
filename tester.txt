A testsuite is a lua script which defines commonly used globals for the
individual tests, and lists those tests in the "tests" table. Each test is a
directory containing a lua script named "__driver__.lua", and optionally any
number of data files. These data files can be copied to the scratch directory
with "get(filename)".

Each test is run in a scratch directory, named tester_dir/$TESTNAME relative to
the directory in which the tester is run. If the test passes and the -d option
is not given, this directory will be removed after the test finishes. The tester
will leave a logfile named "tester.log" in tester_dir and in each scratch dir
that isn't removed.

tester should be called as
	tester testsuite [-dlh] [num [...]] [num..num [...]] [regex [...]]
	
        -h         print a help message
        -l         print test names only; don't run them
        -d         don't clean the scratch directories
        num        run a specific test
        num..num   run tests in a range
                   if num is negative, count back from the end
        regex      run tests with matching names

On startup, the testsuite file is run. It should set up any global vars that the
tests need, and add them to the "tests" table, as 'table.insert(tests,
"test-name")'. "test-name" is the name of the directory for this test relative
to testdir, which is initialized to srcdir (where the testsuite file is).

After this the internal run_tests function is called, which parses the
command-line arguments and runs whichever tests have been asked for. It also
resets most of the environment between tests.


tests

Global table, containing all tests. The testsuite should contain lines of
   table.insert(tests, "test-name")
.

test.root

The scratch directory.

test.name

The name of the test.

test.wanted_fail

Set when an xfailed command succeeds.

test.partial_skip

Set this if you want to note that part of a test is being skipped.

test.log

The logfile for this individual test.

srcdir

Set to the dir containing the testsuite.

testdir

The directory containing all test stuff. Initially set to srcdir. Where all
testsuite-related files are in a subdir except for the testsuite itself, the
testsuite should set this to that dir. For example, the monotone testsuite
sets this to srcdir.."/tests" .

debugging

Set to true if the -d option was given.

logfile

The general log.

failed_testlogs

List of logfiles for failed tests, to be appended to the general log.

files

Table of files for built-in commands (grep, cat, sort, etc) to use for i/o.



P(...)

Print arguments (written to stdout and to the main logfile).

L(...)

Log arguments (written to the test logfile, which will be appended to the main
logfile if this test fails).

getsrcline()

returns (test.name, sourceline), where sourceline is the line number of the
oldest stack frame which is in the driver file for the current test

locheader()

Line getsrcline(), except that it returns a string suitable for prefixing log
lines, as L(locheader(), message).

err(what [, level])

Cause the test to fail, by throwing an error. This is like error(), except
that it records the getsrcline() of where the error was thrown.

mtime(filename) [logged]

Returns the file modification time.

mkdir(filename) [logged]

Create the specified directory.

existsonpath(name) [logged]

Returns true if "name" is on the path.

numlines(filename) [logged]

Count the lines in a file.

open_or_err()

Wrapper around io.open, that throws instead of returning an error code.

fsize(filename)

Return the size of the given file.

readfile(filename) [logged]

Return the contents of a file. The unlogged version is readfile_q.

readstdfile(filename)

Calls readfile(), taking filename as relative to the testsuite directory.

writefile(filename [, dat]) [logged]

If dat is given, set the file contents to dat. If dat is not given, only make
sure that the file exists. The unlogged version is writefile_q.

append(filename [, dat]) [logged]

Append dat to the given file.

copy(from, to) [logged]

Copy a file or a directory tree. The unlogged version is unlogged_copy.

rename(from, to) [logged]

Like os.rename except that it removes the destination if it already exists
(because os.rename on Windows will not replace an existing destination). The
unlogged version is unlogged_rename.

remove(filename) [logged]

Remove a file or a directory tree. The unlogged version is unlogged_remove.

getstd(name [, as])

Copy a file or a directory tree named 'name' from the testsuite directory to
the scratch directory, giving it the name 'as', or 'name' is as is not given.

get(name [, as])

Copy a file or a directory tree named 'name' from the test directory to
the scratch directory, giving it the name 'as', or 'name' is as is not given.

include(filename)

Load and execute a file, named relative to the testsuite directory.

trim(string)

Return the string, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

execute(path, ...) [internal]

Run an external program, and return the program's return code.

runcmd(cmd, prefix, bgnd) [internal]

Run cmd under i/o redirection. cmd is a table giving either a function and
arguments, or an external program name and agruments.

samefile(left, right)

Return true if the given files have identical contents, or false otherwise.

samelines(file, table)

Split the file into lines, and check that each line matches the corresponding
element of the table. This function doesn't care what the line endings are.

greplines(file, table)

Split the file into lines, and check that each line is matched by the regex
given in the corresponding table element.

grep(["-qv"], "what" [, "filename"])
cat(...)
tail(file, num)
sort([filename])

These functions each return a table, suitable for passing to pcall() or check().
They are meant to be used in place of the shell utilities of the same names.

log_file_contents(filename)

Write the contents of the given file to the test log.

pre_cmd() [internal]

Set up the files used for i/o redirection of commands.

post_cmd() [internal]

Verify that a command gave the expected results, and throw an error if it
did not.

bg(torun, ret, stdout, stderr, stdin)

Run a command in the background. The arguments are:
	torun	list of strings, {"program", "arg1", "arg2" ,...}
	ret	expected return code
	std{out,err}
		false	ignore output
		true	save the output in a file named stdout or stderr
		string	the string must match the output
		{string} the named file must match the output
		nil (not given)	the output must be empty
	stdin
		true	use existing "stdin" file
		nil, false	empty input
		string	contents of string are used as input
		{string} contents of named file are used as input
The returned object has two methods:
	finish(timeout)
		wait for the given timeout, then kill the program and check
		the results. Returns true.
	wait(timeout)
		wait for the given timeout. If the program has ended, check
		the results and return true. Otherwise, return false.

runcheck() [internal]

check(), minus some of the input validation

indir(dir, cmd)

cmd is a command table, as would be passed to check(). This wraps what it would
do with a chdir() pair to run it in the given directory.

check(first, ...)

Run a command, and verify the results:
	check(torun, ret, stdout, stderr, stdin)
		Inputs are the same as to bg().
	check(bool)
		Throw an error if the argument is false.
	check(number)
		Check that the argument is zero.
If the command fails, abort the test.

skip_if(bool)

If the argument is true, abort the test (throw true) and mark it as skipped.

xfail(...)

Equivalent to xfail_if(true, ...).

xfail_if(chk, ...)

Give the ... arguments to check(), and catch any errors. If chk is false just
rethrow anything caught, so this wrapper is transparent. If chk is true, then
either mark the test for unexpected success (if the command succeeded), or
abort and mark it as an expected failure (throw false).

log_error() [internal]

Write a caught error to the test log.

run_tests() [internal]

Parse command line arguments, load the testsuite, and run specified tests.


regex.search()
globish.match()
parse_basic_io()

These functions are the same as in monotone.


go_to_test_dir() [internal]
set_redirect() [internal]
clear_redirect() [internal]
clean_test_dir() [internal]
leave_test_dir() [internal]
save_env() [internal]
restore_env() [internal]

Misc. infrastructure.

get_source_dir()

Return the directory the testsuite file was in.

chdir()

Go to a directory. You probably want to use indir() instead.

exists()
isdir()

File status checks.

get_ostype

Return a string representing the OS. You probably care mostly about the
first word.

set_env()

Set an environment variable.

posix_umask

Set the umask on posix systems, do nothing on Windows. If a test uses this, it
should have a relevant skip_if.
  
initial_dir

Global variable, set to the directory the test program was started in.
