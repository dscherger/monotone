- mode 0777 -> mtn:execute; -kb -> mtn:manual_merge
- .cvsignore -> .mtnignore
- separate child node mode when committing (can change keywords and move revisions
to attributes), make descendants merge nodes

I'd like to talk about examples, I've just added a graph of the test
importing_cvs_cycle_splitter3 to the CvsImport. It shows a cycle with a
branch start. You can find the appropriate CVS repo in the test suite.
Figure out how you want that represented in monotone! (And yes, such things
occur in the wild.)

christof: No. The example we came up with is: one programmer developing a
feature A' and not updating but checking in, one creating B' and checking in
without updating. Now after some time they realize that both changes
conflict. So the branch off their development, continue work and later merge
everything together in HEAD again. Now if you look at the tag, they will not
match an existing point in linear history
