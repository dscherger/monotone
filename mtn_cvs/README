This is the directory for mtn_cvs - a program allowing syncing between
Monotone and CVS.

This program can be built by placing the mtn_cvs source directory
inside a monotone source directory, applying the 'mainline.patch'
file to that monotone source directory, and then building
the monotone executable as normal.

This particular branch has an old mainline in it.  This branch of
mainline may not have all the changes propagated from trunk.

--- internals ---

Monotone cvs importing works by adding attributes to to the files
recording which CVS version they correspond to.  A commit in
monotone will simply carry those attributes forward, but they
will then be out of date.  Hence there is also a certificate
added to revisions that are synchronised.  The attributes
then correspond to the last synchronised CVS revision, not
the current cvs revision.

A result of this design is that push into cvs results in a
commit into monotone adding a child with the updated attributes.
