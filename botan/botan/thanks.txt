  The implementation of DES is based off a public domain implementation by Phil
  Karn from 1994 (he, in turn, credits Richard Outerbridge and Jim Gillogly).

  Rijndael and Square are based on the reference implementations written by
  the inventors, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen.

  The Serpent S-boxes used were discovered by Dag Arne Osvik and detailed in
  his paper "Speeding Up Serpent".

  Matthew Skala's public domain twofish.c (as given in GnuPG 0.9.8) provided
  the basis for my Twofish code (particularly the key schedule).

  Some of the hash functions (MD5, SHA-1, etc) use an optimized implementation
  of one of the boolean functions, which was discovered by Colin Plumb.

  The design of Randpool takes some of it's design principles from those
  suggested by Eric A. Young in his SSLeay documentation, Peter Gutmann's paper
  "Software Generation of Practically Strong Random Numbers", and the paper
  "Cryptanalytic Attacks on Pseudorandom Number Generators", by Kelsey,
  Schneier, Wagner, and Hall.
