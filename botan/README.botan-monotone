This botan/ subdirectory is maintained in a separate staging branch
(currently au.asn.ucc.matt.botan.monotone-2). This avoids pulling the entire
net.randombit.botan history into net.venge.monotone. It also evades the issue
of being unable to resurrect files (a problem of die-die-die merge), as
unwanted files are just moved into a.a.u.m.b.monotone-2's Attic/ directory.

Steps to update net.venge.monotone.botan with net.randombit.net:

1) "mtn pull randombit.net net.randombit.botan"

2) "mtn propagate net.randombit.botan au.asn.ucc.matt.botan.monotone-2"

3) "mtn up" in an a.a.u.m.b.monotone-2 workspace. 
   In a n.v.m.botan botan/ dir, do "rm *".
   Then copy the entire / contents (no subdirs though) from the staging
   branch's root dir to the botan/ dir.

4) "mtn ls unknown botan/" and "mtn ls missing botan/" in n.v.m.botan. If 
   there are obviously renamed files, use "mtn rename" to fix them. 
   Otherwise add/drop files as appropriate. Also fix up Makefile.am.

4) make check in n.v.m.botan. If it succeeds, commit. If there are problems,
   copy the changes back to the staging branch and commit there as well. You
   might need to move some files from Attic/src/ to / in the staging branch.

Update this file if things don't work, and remember to push the staging branch
to venge.net.
