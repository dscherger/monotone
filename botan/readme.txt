Please note that this is an experimental / development version of Botan.
Don't be surprised by bugs. No, the documentation hasn't been updated
(yet). Feedback and critical analysis is highly appreciated. If this
sounds scary, use the latest 1.4 release instead. You can file bugs at
http://www.randombit.net/bugzilla
