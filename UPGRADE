upgrading monotone to 0.17
==========================

if you are upgrading from:
  - 0.14 or earlier: see file README.changesets
  - 0.15 or later: see below.

upgrading from 0.15 or 0.16
---------------------------

there was still some residual badness in the revision graph code in
0.16.  we think we've caught it all now (we hope!), and there is now a
great deal more coordinated effort put into stopping any such thing
from sneaking in again, but... we have to do something about the
badness that's already there.

the solution is, another rebuild, like in the 0.15 -> 0.16
transition.  

first, you need to dump your database to SQL text, and then reload it;
this is because we upgraded to SQLite 3 (from SQLite 2), which allows
arbitrary sized files, but uses a different on-disk format.  this
requires the use of your old 

if you've been tracking the pre-0.17 development mainline, then you
should do the same thing, except skipping the dump/load (because you
did it already, when we merged in sqlite3 support).
