  // This function does a breadth-first search from a starting point, until it
  // finds some node that matches an arbitrary condition.  The intended usage
  // is for finding reconstruction paths in a database of deltas -- we start
  // from the node we want to reconstruct, and follow existing deltas outward
  // until we reach a full-text base.  We return the shortest path from
  // 'start' to a base version.
  //
  // The algorithm involves keeping a set of parallel linear paths, starting
  // from 'start', that move forward through the DAG until we hit a base.
  //
  // On each iteration, we extend every active path by one step. If our
  // extension involves a fork, we duplicate the path. If any path
  // contains a cycle, we fault.
  //
  // If, by extending a path C, we enter a node which another path
  // D has already seen, we kill path C. This avoids the possibility of
  // exponential growth in the number of paths due to extensive forking
  // and merging.

  // Long ago, we used to do this with the boost graph library, but it
  // invovled loading too much of the storage graph into memory at any
  // moment. this imperative version only loads the descendents of the
  // reconstruction node, so it much cheaper in terms of memory.
