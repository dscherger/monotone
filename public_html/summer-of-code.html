<h2>Google Summer of Code</h2>
<p>
Google is organizing a fantastic opportunity for students to help out
with FLOSS development this summer, and get paid for doing it.  More
information is available on <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">their site</a>.
<A href="http://venge.net/monotone">Monotone</a> is a distributed
version control system, in the same space as CVS, Subversion,
Arch, Darcs, and <a href="others.html">others</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you've been wanting to get more involved in the monotone project,
have some relevant experience, and are a student, then here are some
project ideas that might be worth submitting.  If you <i>are</i>
interested in applying, you should probably drop by <a
href="irc://irc.oftc.net/#monotone">#monotone on irc.oftc.net</a>; I'm
often around (nick "njs"), as are others, and we can help you figure
out what would be a good match (possibly something that's not even on
this list!), give more details on each of them, etc.  Or suggest your
own ideas...
</p>
<p>
UI improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There's currently a somewhat clunky <a href="http://grahame.angrygoats.net/viewmtn.shtml">web interface</a> to Monotone
    repositories; it could do with a great deal of cleaning up and
    polish.  One interesting idea would be to provide a "google maps"
    like interface to history browsing; this could greatly improve on
    the state of the art in web VCS interfaces, while being quite
    interesting to anyone with an interest in Javascript, DHTML,
    and so on.  Some more detailed ideas <a href="http://www.loglibrary.com/dialogue/view/73">are available</a>.</li>
<li>An interactive merge tool that uses the new "precise
    codeville-merge" algorithm.  Precise cdv-merge is greatly superior
    to traditional 3-way merge, but while there are many slick
    interfaces to make doing 3-way merge easy, there are none for
    cdv-merge.  Such a tool would benefit multiple VCS projects, and
    has interesting challenges, while still being within the scope of
    a 2-month project.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Core improvements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Merge-via-working-directory: A major UI problem in monotone has
    been that merges happen directly against the repository, rather
    than into a working directory where they can be inspected before
    being committed.  We know how to do this; but no-one's had the
    time.</li>
<li>Make cvs_import work better: Importing history from CVS turns out
    to be a much harder problem than one might think.  Monotone has a cvs importer,
    but it's buggy.  The project would be to make it less buggy.  We
    suspect this is solvable, since cvs2svn does quite a good job with
    the more annoying parts of the problem, but someone needs to figure
    out how cvs2svn manages it, and make it work for monotone.</li>
<li>git_import: The linux kernel has recently started using a tool
    "git" for managing development.  git is conceptually very close to
    monotone, but with arguably inferior merging, communication, and
    storage systems, while monotone is catching up with it in speed.
    Some kernel developers might prefer to use monotone, given the
    choice; give them that option by writing an incremental, lossless
    history importer from git.</li>
<li>Distributed trust delegation: Monotone is designed around a novel
    security model, designed for development efforts that cut across
    organizational and trust boundaries -- so users have a great deal
    of flexibility in whose code they trust, and under what
    circumstances.  However, to make this ergonomic in practice, users
    need to be able to defer some decisions to others --
    to say "I trust the main developers to tell me who gets commit
    access", for instance.  We have a plausible design sketch for how
    to do this, but again, time constraints have prevented its
    implementation; implement it.  This project would be pushing the
    state-of-the-art in distributed systems security; I'm not aware of
    any other work that has addressed this particular problem.  Some
    more detailed discussion <a href="http://frances.vorpus.org/~njs/mt-permission.log">is available</a>.</li>
<li>monotone-agent: Monotone needs passwords to unlock keys; typing
    passwords is annoying.  Either implement a "monotone-agent"
    analogous to ssh-agent, or else teach monotone to use ssh-agent
    directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make botan faster: Botan is a nice C++ library for crypto.  Crypto++
    is a somewhat grungier C++ library for crypto.  We would like to use Botan,
    but at the moment we use Crypto++, because Botan is slower.  This is probably
    just a matter of finding the various fast crypto kernels that float aorund on the
    net (or are in Crypto++), porting them to Botan's framework, and submitting for
    inclusion upstream.</li>
<li>Portable asynchronous programming library: This is somewhat
    different from the other projects.  Several features that would be
    very nice in monotone (network proxy support, for instance) have
    been delayed by the difficulty of writing portable (POSIX+Win32)
    code to deal with pipes, sockets, and processes.  Coincidentally,
    we also have the prototype of a library to deal with these issues,
    that could be useful for many projects.  (Basically, a C++ version
    of the Python "Twisted" library.)  It hasn't received much
    attention from the core developers, due to a desire to avoid
    losing focus, but this could be a very valuable project for
    someone to pick up.  This would be excellent experience for anyone
    interested in learning the nitty-gritty of asynchronous
    programming, though some prior knowledge of the area is probably required.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Applying</h2>
<p>
My understanding is that each project will review applications submitted for it.
So here are some guidelines for things that <I>I</I> would like seeing in
applications (and possibly other project reviewers would like too):
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Experience</b>: I can't teach people to code.  Sorry; just not enough hours
in the day.  Therefore, it is very helpful to see some evidence that you can code,
and will be able to get up to speed and contributing quickly (the whole thing is
only 2 months!).  The goal is to provide something valuable to you, <i>and</i> to
the project (and the public generally).  Convince me you can and will do this.</li>
<li><b>Have I seen your code?/Is there somewhere I could go to see
your code?</b>: Same reason as above, but an even better indicator.</li>
<li><b>How much time are you thinking to put in?</b>: roughly speaking.</li>
<li><b>What's your goal afterwards?</b>: Do you want to finish a project and stop after August?
Or do you see this as a way to kickstart work want to continue afterwards?  This has
a big effect on what a reasonable goal is.</li>
<li><b>Meta-point</b>: Convince me you're reasonable, you've thought about what you want
to do, why you want to do it, that it's plausible for you to accomplish what you want, that you'll benefit from
doing so, and that it's worth doing.  Summer of Code is going to have somewhere under a 10% acceptance
rate, and to stand out you need to show that you're one of those &lt;10% who are worth spending
the time and money on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Other things to consider: software development and schedules don't,
in practice, really mix.  The goals of having a well-defined project to work on, and of
actually making effective use of your time, can often be in direct conflict.
So while working out a project plan is a great idea to get started, don't expect
it to necessarily define what you'll do; FLOSS development works best when you
work on the things you want to do, that you find tractable, and that make sense
within the community.  Expect other people to tell you that your code sucks, or that
it rocks, or that someone else will wander in and do half of the work you were planning
to.  End conclusion: expect projects above to be starting points, not exhaustive plans.  (Of course,
some people may find that they work all summer on one thing, and finish it right at the
end.  Weirder things have happened.)
</p>
<p>
And, special tip for those who made it to the bottom of the page:
the absolute best way to get any FLOSS developer interested, and the
absolute first thing you should do when interested in starting to work
on a project, is to write some sort of useful, simple patch and send it
in.  Monotone has a <a href="quickies.html">list of ideas</a> for such patches.
