This is a test branch for the Monotone::AutomateStdio Perl library. This branch
is branched off from Monotone version 0.41 and contains random changes in order
to exercise specific bits of the automate stdio interface and the
Monotone::AutomateStdio library. This branch must in no way ever be merged back
to the main Monotone branch.
