* packet commands -> automate? (combines with next item:)
* use automate stdio interface (and automate get_revision) to make
   export much faster
* merkle dir stuff that doesn't require loading entire chunks into
   memory all the time
* ftp write
   - probably refactor SFTP file write stuff
* pipelining on http read? (is urlgrabber thread-safe?)
* possibly better rollback stuff?
  - truncate DATA when possible? (local, sftp (with a simple call
   to a private method)
  - include some info in the lockdir on who has things locked, to aid
   in detecting staleness of locks
* file reader needs to do the pause/retry thing on missing files
