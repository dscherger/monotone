main files:
-----------

Graydon Hoare <graydon@pobox.com> originally wrote *.{lua,sql,cc,hh}
in the top level directory. That's me.

Two exceptions are the file main.cc, which is a slightly reworked copy
of execution_monitor.cc from the boost project; and the file
mkstemp.cc, which is a slightly reworked copy of mkstemp code from
glib. In both cases I've noted the original copyrights in the files.

Another possible exception -- depending on how you interpret the word
"wrote" -- is the file lcs.hh, which I did write, but the writing was
merely *translation* (without much inventive contribution) from a file
called differ.scm, from SLIB, which is written by Aubrey Jaffer
<agj@alum.mit.edu>, and on which he retains Copyright. He has licensed
this code for any use provided its copyright notice is preserved,
which it is, in lcs.hh. You can find the original (scheme) code at
http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/

Several of the top level files have subsequently been amended by other
contributing authors, including:

supporting files:
-----------------

D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com> wrote the files in sqlite/*, but is in
no way affiliated with this project. I simply copied his code, which
is assigned to the public domain. You can find the original code at
http://www.sqlite.org.


Wei Dai <weidai@eskimo.com> wrote many of the files in cryptopp/*,
though possibly not all of them; the files themselves were assigned to
the public domain, and Wei Dai retains copyright only over the
collective work of the crypto++ library from whence they were
copied. I make no claim to be representing the crypto++ collective
work here; I am merely using several public domain files from it. You
can find the original code at http://www.cryptopp.com.
