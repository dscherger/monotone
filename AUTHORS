main files:
-----------

Graydon Hoare <graydon@pobox.com> originally wrote *.{lua,sql,cc,hh}
in the top level directory. That's me.

One possible exception to this -- depending on how you interpret the
word "wrote" -- is the file lcs.hh, which I merely *translated*
(without much inventive contribution) from a file called differ.scm,
from SLIB, which is written by Aubrey Jaffer <agj@alum.mit.edu>, and
on which he retains Copyright. He has licensed this code for any use
provided its copyright notice is preserved, which it is, in
lcs.hh. You can find the original (scheme) code at
http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/~jaffer/

Several of the top level files have subsequently been amended by other
contributing authors, including:

  Tom Tromey <tromey@redhat.com>
  Nathaniel Smith <njs@pobox.com>
  Matt Kraai  <kraai@ftbfs.org>
  Lorenzo Campedelli <lorenzo.campedelli@libero.it>


supporting files:
-----------------

D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com> wrote the files in sqlite/*, but is in
no way affiliated with this project. I simply copied his code, which
is assigned to the public domain. You can find the original code at
http://www.sqlite.org.


Wei Dai <weidai@eskimo.com> wrote many of the files in cryptopp/*,
though possibly not all of them; the files themselves were assigned to
the public domain, and Wei Dai retains copyright only over the
collective work of the crypto++ library from whence they were
copied. I make no claim to be representing the crypto++ collective
work here; I am merely using several public domain files from it. You
can find the original code at http://www.cryptopp.com.


The files in adns/* are copies of the core portion of the "adns"
library. Copyright 1997-2001 Ian Jackson, Copyright 1999-2000 Tony
Finch, and Copyright (C) 1991 Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. They are licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or greater.
The original sources for adns can be retrieved from
http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/


The files in lua/* are copies of the lua 5.0 source distribution, from
Tecgraf PUC-Rio. The lua distribution can be retrieved from
www.lua.org. The files are provided under an MIT-like license,

The files in boost/* are copies of unofficial development files from
the boost "sandbox" CVS repository, linked off of
http://www.boost.org. The only license obligation I can find in those
files is to reproduce their license statement in documentation, which
I am doing here:

copyright status:
-----------------

I believe I am within my rights to assert my own copyright on:

  - the files I wrote

  - the collective work, including the use (though not authorship) of
    files I copied from the public domain, and other copyrighted but
    freely-licensed sources (and possibly lcs.cc, as mentionned)

I license my publication of these copyrighted works to the public
under the terms of the GNU GPL, version 2 or greater. See the file
COPYING for details. If you believe I am in violation of some existing
copyrights, please contact me.

Subsequent additions by contributing authors are implicitly licensed
to the public under the same terms (GPL), but the contributing authors
retain copyrights on their portions of the work.
