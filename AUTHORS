Graydon Hoare <graydon@pobox.com> wrote *.{sql,cc,hh} in the top level
directory. That's me.


D. Richard Hipp <drh@hwaci.com> wrote the files in sqlite/*, but is in no way
affiliated with this project. I simply copied his code, which is assigned to
the public domain. You can find the original code at http://www.sqlite.org.


Wei Dai <weidai@eskimo.com> wrote many of the files in cryptopp/*, though
possibly not all of them; the files themselves were assigned to the public
domain, and Wei Dai retains copyright only over the collective work of the
crypto++ library from whence they were copied. I make no claim to be
representing the crypto++ collective work here; I am merely using several
public domain files from it. You can find the original code at
http://www.cryptopp.com.


The files in boost/* are copies of unofficial development files from the boost
"sandbox" CVS repository, linked off of http://www.boost.org. The only license
obligation I can find in those files is to reproduce their license statement in
documentation, which I am doing here:

I believe I am within my rights to assert my own copyright on both the files I
wrote and the collective work including these files I copied from the public
domain. I am licensing my publication of these copyrighted works under the GNU
GPL. See the file COPYING for details. If you believe I am in violation of some
existing copyrights, please contact me.
