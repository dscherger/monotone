Revision history for Perl extension Monotone::AutomateStdio.

0.06  Sat Nov 7 15:27:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated library to take into account the changes made in Monotone
	  0.45. This also includes the documentation. Changes include:
	  - tags() and certs() now return a has as a key or signer rather than
	    their name.
	  - content_diff() now supports the --reverse and --with-headers
	    options.
	  - keys() now returns given_name and local_name instead of just name.
	- Tested against a 0.45 database and also updated the test harness to
	  reflect the above changes.
	- Made the exception handling code more consistent and cleaner.
	- Corrected the use of IO::Poll's mask method and added POLLHUP to the
	  mask.
	- Now much more explicit in handling the reaping of subprocesses and
	  much more robust in the face of a subprocess that won't die.
	- Now test for the presence of exceptions by using a simple boolean
	  test.
	- Now cope with open3() throwing exceptions whilst inside the child
	  process.
	- Now allow the --rcfile switch.
	- Made other small consistency tidy ups.

	- Updated for Monotone version 0.44:
	  - Added support for the w: selector (feature MTN_W_SELECTOR).
	  - Modified the genkey() and keys() methods to cope with the common
	    single hash as against separate private and public ones (feature
	    MTN_COMMON_KEY_HASH).
	- The type field has been dropped from the records returned by the
	  keys() method. It wasn't really needed as only one field is sometimes
	  not available.
	- Updated mtn-tester so as to reduce avoidable churn in the test output
	  and to also correctly deal with the data returned by the
	  get_revision() method.
	- Updated and tidied up the POD documentation to reflect the above
	  changes.
	- Now supports the conversion of UTF-8 data into and out of Perl's
	  internal UTF-8 string format for data read in from and sent out to
	  the mtn subprocess.
	- Added a suppress_utf8_conversion() method for disabling the above
	  conversion if so desired.

	- Updated for Monotone version 0.43, (added support for the m: and u:
	  selectors).
	- Corrected and simplified the `Have I got a class thingy as my first
	  argument?' logic in light of issues encountered when I tried to
	  derive from this class.
	- Updated the test harness in light of previous interface changes and
	  the fact that mtn revert is more noisy now (use the -quiet switch).
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Switched to the OO way of calling methods, more consistent.
	- Renamed the can() method to supports() so as not to conflict with
	  Perl's UNIVERSAL can() method.
	- Renamed some of the capability constants so as to fit in more
	  naturally with the method renamed above.

0.03  Sun Feb 8 18:22:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Improved an error message (which was causing compilation to fail
	  anyway).
	- Added the $mtn->switch_to_ws_root() class method.
	- Documented the above and under the NOTES section went into greater
	  detail the issues surrounding using mtn inside workspaces.
	- Changed the order of the Changes file (most recent first).
	- Clarified some POD file text.

0.02  Wed Jan 7 16:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated to work with Monotone version 0.42 (added the
	  $mtn->file_merge(), $mtn->lua() and $mtn->read_packets() methods and
	  added support for the --no-workspace mtn command line switch).
	- Added contributions and ideas from Thomas Keller:
	  - Now have two constructors new_from_db() and new_from_ws(). The
	    first is aliased to new() and does what the old constructor did.
	    The second constructor uses the details from the specified
	    workspace.
	  - The databases are checked to see if they are Monotone SQLite v3
	    databases before they are opened by the mtn subprocess.
	  - The get_ws_path() method has been added.
	  - The mtn subprocess is either started inside the root directory (if
	    no workspace is being used) or in the top level directory inside
	    the specified/current workspace. This helps avoid all sorts of
	    confusion and weirdness with the mtn subprocess.
	- Added the db_locked_condition_detected() method.
	- Now support the NULL key type in parse_kv_record to allow for cases
	  where there is a field key without a value.
	- Revamped all of the regexp string extraction code to be more
	  efficient.
	- The $io_stanza_re regular expression now also extras the key name.
	- Made an exception message more meaningful.
	- mtn-tester has been updated to test the new features and now
	  recreates the $mtn object after doing its initial tests so that any
	  error messages are cleared out prior to the actual tests.
	- Updated the documentation as a result of the new 0.42 features. I
	  have included a new EXAMPLES section, which details some of the less
	  obvious features, and an AUTHORS section. I have also revamped the
	  RETURN VALUE section to make it more readable).
