Revision history for Perl extension Monotone::AutomateStdio.

0.09  Thu Aug 12 17:40:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added support for Monotone version 0.48 by adding the update()
	  method.
	- Made the the code that reads format 2 chunk headers slightly more
	  efficient (avoids calling poll() more than it has to).
	- Now recognise development versions of Monotone.
	- Updated the documentation (and corrected a typo).
	- Updated mtn-tester for Monotone version 0.48 and now added code to
	  print out the return value from the get_error_message() method after
	  each test.

0.08  Sun May 23 10:00:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- The get_db_name() method now returns undef instead of ":memory:" when
	  connecting to a network service.
	- Added the get_service_name() method.
	- Corrected a bug where retries on locked db caused exceptions to be
	  thrown in the startup routine despite the retry handler successfully
	  dealing with the situation and waiting until the db was unlocked.
	- Now stop deep recursion from happening in the above situation.
	- Improved the logic in error handling inside the startup routine so
	  that the best error message is generated.
	- Improved some exception messages and other minor code tidy-ups.
	- Updates the documentation and corrected a few typos.

0.07  Sat Feb 27 19:30:00 2010 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added support for 0.46:
	  - Added support for extracting the extra automate stdio data streams
	    new in 0.46.
	  - Added support for automate remote_stdio via the new_from_service()
	    contructor.
	  - Added the pull(), push() and sync() methods.
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Added a return statement to the end of all methods that don't return
	  anything so that nothing can be accidentally leaked (Perl subroutines
	  by default return the value of the last expression executed).
	- Now use the getlines() method instead of <>.
	- SIGPIPE is now ignored (caused the program to terminate when the mtn
	  subprocess exited unexpectedly and this library was in the middle of
	  sending it something).
	- Stopped using abbreviated words in error messages.
	- Rationalised the use of die() croaker() and carper() (some things
	  were carping when they should have been croaking).
	- Used the OO style of calling print() and printf() so that
	  $this->{mtn_in} could be used directly.
	- Short reads on reading data cause errors rather than a blocking read.
	- Restructured some code in mtn_command_with_options() to be more
	  logically grouped.
	- Failure to read the new format header does not obscure potentially
	  more helpful error messages.
	- Get more consistent results (WRT irrelevant Data::Dumper related
	  white space) if UTF-8 conversion is switched off.
	- Switched over to custom Inside Out object design.
	- The version numbers are not treated as floating point numbers.
	- Made the convertion from UTF-8 into Perl's internal string format
	  handle errors in a better way.
	- Made the handling of the convert_to_utf8 flag a little bit more
	  consistent with other such flags.
	- Some code tidy ups.
	- Added new tests for mtn version 0.46 and updated the test results
	  with the corresponding output.
	- Corrected some comments.

0.06  Sat Nov 7 15:27:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated library to take into account the changes made in Monotone
	  0.45. This also includes the documentation. Changes include:
	  - tags() and certs() now return a has as a key or signer rather than
	    their name.
	  - content_diff() now supports the --reverse and --with-headers
	    options.
	  - keys() now returns given_name and local_name instead of just name.
	- Tested against a 0.45 database and also updated the test harness to
	  reflect the above changes.
	- Made the exception handling code more consistent and cleaner.
	- Corrected the use of IO::Poll's mask method and added POLLHUP to the
	  mask.
	- Now much more explicit in handling the reaping of subprocesses and
	  much more robust in the face of a subprocess that won't die.
	- Now test for the presence of exceptions by using a simple boolean
	  test.
	- Now cope with open3() throwing exceptions whilst inside the child
	  process.
	- Now allow the --rcfile switch.
	- Made other small consistency tidy ups.

0.05  Fri Jun 5 17:49:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated for Monotone version 0.44:
	  - Added support for the w: selector (feature MTN_W_SELECTOR).
	  - Modified the genkey() and keys() methods to cope with the common
	    single hash as against separate private and public ones (feature
	    MTN_COMMON_KEY_HASH).
	- The type field has been dropped from the records returned by the
	  keys() method. It wasn't really needed as only one field is sometimes
	  not available.
	- Updated mtn-tester so as to reduce avoidable churn in the test output
	  and to also correctly deal with the data returned by the
	  get_revision() method.
	- Updated and tidied up the POD documentation to reflect the above
	  changes.
	- Now supports the conversion of UTF-8 data into and out of Perl's
	  internal UTF-8 string format for data read in from and sent out to
	  the mtn subprocess.
	- Added a suppress_utf8_conversion() method for disabling the above
	  conversion if so desired.

0.04  Sun May 3 19:19:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated for Monotone version 0.43, (added support for the m: and u:
	  selectors).
	- Corrected and simplified the `Have I got a class thingy as my first
	  argument?' logic in light of issues encountered when I tried to
	  derive from this class.
	- Updated the test harness in light of previous interface changes and
	  the fact that mtn revert is more noisy now (use the -quiet switch).
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Switched to the OO way of calling methods, more consistent.
	- Renamed the can() method to supports() so as not to conflict with
	  Perl's UNIVERSAL can() method.
	- Renamed some of the capability constants so as to fit in more
	  naturally with the method renamed above.

0.03  Sun Feb 8 18:22:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Improved an error message (which was causing compilation to fail
	  anyway).
	- Added the $mtn->switch_to_ws_root() class method.
	- Documented the above and under the NOTES section went into greater
	  detail the issues surrounding using mtn inside workspaces.
	- Changed the order of the Changes file (most recent first).
	- Clarified some POD file text.

0.02  Wed Jan 7 16:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated to work with Monotone version 0.42 (added the
	  $mtn->file_merge(), $mtn->lua() and $mtn->read_packets() methods and
	  added support for the --no-workspace mtn command line switch).
	- Added contributions and ideas from Thomas Keller:
	  - Now have two constructors new_from_db() and new_from_ws(). The
	    first is aliased to new() and does what the old constructor did.
	    The second constructor uses the details from the specified
	    workspace.
	  - The databases are checked to see if they are Monotone SQLite v3
	    databases before they are opened by the mtn subprocess.
	  - The get_ws_path() method has been added.
	  - The mtn subprocess is either started inside the root directory (if
	    no workspace is being used) or in the top level directory inside
	    the specified/current workspace. This helps avoid all sorts of
	    confusion and weirdness with the mtn subprocess.
	- Added the db_locked_condition_detected() method.
	- Now support the NULL key type in parse_kv_record to allow for cases
	  where there is a field key without a value.
	- Revamped all of the regexp string extraction code to be more
	  efficient.
	- The $io_stanza_re regular expression now also extras the key name.
	- Made an exception message more meaningful.
	- mtn-tester has been updated to test the new features and now
	  recreates the $mtn object after doing its initial tests so that any
	  error messages are cleared out prior to the actual tests.
	- Updated the documentation as a result of the new 0.42 features. I
	  have included a new EXAMPLES section, which details some of the less
	  obvious features, and an AUTHORS section. I have also revamped the
	  RETURN VALUE section to make it more readable).
