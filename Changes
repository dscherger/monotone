Revision history for Perl extension Monotone::AutomateStdio.

0.04  Sun May 3 19:19:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated for Monotone version 0.43, (added support for the m: and u:
	  selectors).
	- Corrected and simplified the `Have I got a class thingy as my first
	  argument?' logic in light of issues encountered when I tried to
	  derive from this class.
	- Updated the test harness in light of previous interface changes and
	  the fact that mtn revert is more noisy now (use the -quiet switch).
	- Updated the POD documentation.
	- Switched to the OO way of calling methods, more consistent.
	- Renamed the can() method to supports() so as not to conflict with
	  Perl's UNIVERSAL can() method.
	- Renamed some of the capability constants so as to fit in more
	  naturally with the method renamed above.

	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Improved an error message (which was causing compilation to fail
	  anyway).
	- Added the $mtn->switch_to_ws_root() class method.
	- Documented the above and under the NOTES section went into greater
	  detail the issues surrounding using mtn inside workspaces.
	- Changed the order of the Changes file (most recent first).
	- Clarified some POD file text.

0.02  Wed Jan 7 16:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Updated to work with Monotone version 0.42 (added the
	  $mtn->file_merge(), $mtn->lua() and $mtn->read_packets() methods and
	  added support for the --no-workspace mtn command line switch).
	- Added contributions and ideas from Thomas Keller:
	  - Now have two constructors new_from_db() and new_from_ws(). The
	    first is aliased to new() and does what the old constructor did.
	    The second constructor uses the details from the specified
	    workspace.
	  - The databases are checked to see if they are Monotone SQLite v3
	    databases before they are opened by the mtn subprocess.
	  - The get_ws_path() method has been added.
	  - The mtn subprocess is either started inside the root directory (if
	    no workspace is being used) or in the top level directory inside
	    the specified/current workspace. This helps avoid all sorts of
	    confusion and weirdness with the mtn subprocess.
	- Added the db_locked_condition_detected() method.
	- Now support the NULL key type in parse_kv_record to allow for cases
	  where there is a field key without a value.
	- Revamped all of the regexp string extraction code to be more
	  efficient.
	- The $io_stanza_re regular expression now also extras the key name.
	- Made an exception message more meaningful.
	- mtn-tester has been updated to test the new features and now
	  recreates the $mtn object after doing its initial tests so that any
	  error messages are cleared out prior to the actual tests.
	- Updated the documentation as a result of the new 0.42 features. I
	  have included a new EXAMPLES section, which details some of the less
	  obvious features, and an AUTHORS section. I have also revamped the
	  RETURN VALUE section to make it more readable).
