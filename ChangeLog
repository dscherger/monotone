Revision history for mtn-browse.

0.62  Sun May 03 18:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added the new relevant selectors introduced in Monotone 0.43.
	- Added the help files.
	- Added the help on window feature.
	- Set up all of the windows for help and context sensitive help.
	- Implemented the context sensitive help feature.
	- Added the home page help menu option.
	- Updated the help manual with details about the new help options and
	  modes, the new selectors introduced in Monotone version 0.43 and the
	  new preference options.
	- Implemented a caching class derived from Monotone::AutomateStdio for
	  caching branch list information. Switched the rest of the application
	  over to this new class.
	- Now weed out unsupported selectors from the GUI depending upon the
	  version of Monotone being used.
	- Added a user preference option for determining how a list search is
	  done (either plain text or as a re).
	- Added user preference options for controlling the look of the
	  toolbar.
	- Gtk2::FileChooserDialog dialog windows now have their current
	  directory location saved between invocations.
	- Added calls to the present() method after each call to
	  show()/show_all() for each window (fixes the focus issue with windows
	  not shown by default on desktops that use click to focus).
	- Corrected a bug with the Advanced Find dialog window's handling of
	  the Find Text dialog window (it didn't reset the search context when
	  loaded with new data nor disabled it when there was no data to
	  search).
	- Enabled the use of the Find Text dialog window within the Advanced
	  Find dialog window.
	- Both the Advanced Find and Preferences dialog windows are now no
	  longer modal as this is taken care of by the WindowManager class.
	- Now no longer rely on modal dialog windows, deal with it ourselves
	  (also supporting context sensitive help). This will allow the
	  Advanced Find dialog window to use the Find Text dialog window.
	- Started using the update method on spinbuttons in order to make sure
	  that their internal state is consistent.
	- Fixed the bug where the Advanced Find dialog window did not respond
	  to Shift-<F1>. Basically it seems that the window must not be
	  realised before the accelerator keys have been set up
	  (i.e. ...->show_all() and WindowManager->update_gui() can only be
	  called after WindowManager->instance()->manage()).
	- Renamed the `Separator' selector to `Logical And', it makes more
	  sense.
	- Cleaned up and restructured WindowManager.pm a bit to make it more
	  modular, increase code reuse and make it easier to understand.
	- Corrected a few stack handling issues in the WindowManager class.
	- mtn-browse now correctly gets the name of the database from a
	  workspace regardless of the user's `auto_select' setting.
	- Now display a file's author instead of file id in the main browser
	  window.
	- Fixed a bug whereby the external file comparison button remained
	  enabled when a lone binary file was selected for comparison.
	- When a single file is selected for comparison, the results window is
	  now scrolled to that file.
	- Added Thomas Keller's German locale file for mtn-browse.
	- Switched over to using the supports method instead of the can method.
	- References to MIME are now correctly in upper case.
	- Corrected spelling of cronologically to chronologically.
	- Renamed a few things in the code, Glade file and the help file so as
	  to be more consistent.
	- Removed a redundant routine prototype in Completion.pm (actually
	  caused a warning message).
	- Reinstated the Gnome save window settings setting.
	- Updated the README file in light of additional Makefile.PL command
	  line options and the additional help files that are now installed.
	- The Linux installer now copes with help files.
	- linux-installer now does not require the LIB_DIR setting to have a
	  leading /.
	- Corrected the built in help that comes with linux-installer.
	- The dependency checker now returns the error message rather than
	  displaying it.
	- Corrected some symbolic linking in devl-install relating to help
	  files.
	- Makefile.PL now allows one to specify all of linux-installer's useful
	  options.
	- Did some small code tidy ups.

0.61  Sun Feb 08 18:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added a Makefile.PL style install capability.
	- Split out the dependency checker into a separate module.
	- Updated INSTALL and README with the up to date details of
	  installation.
	- Moved the support modules for linux-installer into their own
	  subdirectory.
	- Beefed up linux-install. It now:
	  - Can take all its information from the command line.
	  - Supports the concept of DESTDIR.
	  - Checks that Perl dependencies have been met.
	  - Has built in help.
	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Added a user preference option for controlling whether line numbers
	  are displayed by default when showing a file's contents.
	- Added a user preference option for controlling whether branch and
	  revision comboboxentries update their lists when the user is typing
	  in values (a performance tuning option).
	- A scroll margin is now used when finding text. This makes it easier
	  to see the context of a found string when it is at the top or bottom
	  of the window.
	- Directory separators are no longer assumed to be '/'.
	- The get_revision_ids routine now correctly uses the current branch to
	  refine the query (can now cope with multiple tags on different
	  branches).
	- Renamed the find_button widget to find_text_button to make it more
	  specific.
	- Annotate window now offers a lot more options via its menu for
	  accessing file and revision change logs and comparing between the
	  current file or revision its parent version.
	- Put some string constants under locale control, they were missed off
	  before by accident.
	- Made sure that all calls to dialogs' run method are granted mouse
	  input by the WindowManager object.
	- The mtn warning handler can be suppressed by the use of a global
	  variable (which can be set using local).
	- Now guard against no external comparison helper application being
	  setup.
	- Refactored some code in History.pm to better help support the new
	  annotate window options.
	- Annotate no longer fails on an empty file.
	- Annotate and comparisons are no longer affected by where the
	  application is run inside a workspace.
	- mtn-browse now always explicitly opens a database rather than relying
	  on the mtn subprocess sorting itself out inside a workspace. This
	  means that the mtn subprocess is always run in the root directory
	  which is much safer WRT unexpected interactions with a workspace.
	- Database locked dialog windows are no longer parented as these
	  dialogs are in fact related to Monotone::AutomateStdio object
	  instances and not browser window instances (which share
	  Monotone::AutomateStdio object instances).
	- Now a little bit better at reporting helper application launch errors
	  to the user.
	- Vertical panes now maintain the size of the left hand window.
	- Implemented the option of selecting a search column in a treeview
	  widget.
	- Searching in a treeview now used REs.

0.60  Fri Jan 23 19:09:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Initial release of the application to Source Forge.
