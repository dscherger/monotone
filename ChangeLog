	This file is no longer used.  Monotone developers' convention is
	now to write ChangeLog-format log messages in the commit logs
	only.

	Many people were duplicating the same text in both places, and
	this caused unnecessary merge conflicts for ordering of the
	serialised ChangeLog file for the non-serialised ancestry graph.

	"mtn log" will produce the same information, sorted in proper
	ancestry order, even with the presence of propagates and putbacks
	of long-running development branches. A copy of this output will
	overwrite this file for release tarballs.

	When writing commit log messages in ChangeLog format, you can omit
	the date and name header, because these will be carried in the
	author and date certs.  Just use the body part, like so:


	* foo.cc (function): change this to foo more efficiently
	* cmd_bar.cc: use the more efficient foo
	* NEWS: tell the users that the bar command is now so much faster.
