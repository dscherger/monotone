Revision history for mtn-browse.

0.61  Sun Feb 08 18:00:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Added a Makefile.PL style install capability.
	- Split out the dependency checker into a separate module.
	- Updated INSTALL and README with the up to date details of
	  installation.
	- Moved the support modules for linux-installer into their own
	  subdirectory.
	- Beefed up linux-install. It now:
	  - Can take all its information from the command line.
	  - Supports the concept of DESTDIR.
	  - Checks that Perl dependencies have been met.
	  - Has built in help.
	- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
	- Added a user preference option for controlling whether line numbers
	  are displayed by default when showing a file's contents.
	- Added a user preference option for controlling whether branch and
	  revision comboboxentries update their lists when the user is typing
	  in values (a performance tuning option).
	- A scroll margin is now used when finding text. This makes it easier
	  to see the context of a found string when it is at the top or bottom
	  of the window.
	- Directory separators are no longer assumed to be '/'.
	- The get_revision_ids routine now correctly uses the current branch to
	  refine the query (can now cope with multiple tags on different
	  branches).
	- Renamed the find_button widget to find_text_button to make it more
	  specific.
	- Annotate window now offers a lot more options via its menu for
	  accessing file and revision change logs and comparing between the
	  current file or revision its parent version.
	- Put some string constants under locale control, they were missed off
	  before by accident.
	- Made sure that all calls to dialogs' run method are granted mouse
	  input by the WindowManager object.
	- The mtn warning handler can be suppressed by the use of a global
	  variable (which can be set using local).
	- Now guard against no external comparison helper application being
	  setup.
	- Refactored some code in History.pm to better help support the new
	  annotate window options.
	- Annotate no longer fails on an empty file.
	- Annotate and comparisons are no longer affected by where the
	  application is run inside a workspace.
	- mtn-browse now always explicitly opens a database rather than relying
	  on the mtn subprocess sorting itself out inside a workspace. This
	  means that the mtn subprocess is always run in the root directory
	  which is much safer WRT unexpected interactions with a workspace.
	- Database locked dialog windows are no longer parented as these
	  dialogs are in fact related to Monotone::AutomateStdio object
	  instances and not browser window instances (which share
	  Monotone::AutomateStdio object instances).
	- Now a little bit better at reporting helper application launch errors
	  to the user.
	- Vertical panes now maintain the size of the left hand window.
	- Implemented the option of selecting a search column in a treeview
	  widget.
	- Searching in a treeview now used REs.

0.60  Fri Jan 23 19:09:00 2009 Anthony Cooper <support@coosoft.plus.com>
	- Initial release of the application to Source Forge.
