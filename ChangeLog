	'monotone' with 'mtn'. Allow more than one standard option on the
	command line.

2006-06-22  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* testsuite.lua: Make sure to set all NLS environment variables
	to "C", so tests don't fail when the default locale is non-
	english.

2006-06-21  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/empty_environment/__driver__.lua: Fix test on Cygwin--copy
	essential DLLs into current directory before emptying $PATH.
	* win32/monotone.iss: Remove hardcoded paths that were
	accidentally left in after debugging.

2006-06-20  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* hash_map.hh: Add a specialization for unsigned long; fixes build
	on Cygwin/GCC 3.4.  Thanks to Lapo Luchini for the original patch.

2006-06-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tester.lua (open_or_err): New function.
	(pre_cmd): Use it.  It should probably be used much more widely,
	but I'm not sure what I'm doing yet...

2006-06-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: Update a little bit, in particular, give a newer boost
	download link in response to complaint on mailing list, and put
	1.9 version number on automake command line.

2006-06-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* configure.ac: Remove autotest-related configury.  
	Add magic AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE options to make tar handle the long
	filenames in the new test suite (automake 1.9 is now required).

2006-06-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): The auto* gods demand sacrifice;
	remove an extra / to balance previous change.
	(NB: apparently a trailing / on a directory in EXTRA_DIST does
	bizarre things.)
	Also, remove empty files tests/atconfig.in, tests/atlocal.in.

2006-06-19  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add missing \.

	* cmd_automate.cc (AUTOMATE(interface_version),AUTOMATE(stdio)),
	cmd_list.cc (AUTOMATE(keys)): Don't send an empty string to
	gettext.  Here's what xgettext said:

	cmd_automate.cc:68: warning: Empty msgid.  It is reserved by GNU gettext:
	                             gettext("") returns the header entry with
	                             meta information, not the empty string.
	cmd_automate.cc:209: warning: Empty msgid.  It is reserved by GNU gettext:
	                              gettext("") returns the header entry with

	I'm quite sure we don't want the header entry printed...

2006-06-19  Alex Queiroz  <alex@ventonegro.org>

2006-06-19  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	create directories {x,y}/{x,y} wherever they run to pass workspace

	from get_netsync_connect_command in order to determine the
	monotone command on the remote host.
	* monotone.texi: Document get_mtn_command, update the

2006-06-17  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	strings are handled.

2006-06-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: One new untranslated string and a couple of fuzzies.

2006-06-17  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* configure.ac, debian/changelog, monotone.spec:
	* win32/monotone.iss, NEWS, UPGRADE: Bump version numbers to
	0.27.

2006-06-17  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	(see bug #15995, asking for a more comprehensive automate command set)
	Start splitting up automate.cc . There is now an AUTOMATE() macro in
	cmd.hh , similar to the CMD() macro. Individual automate commands can
	share a file with similar command-line commands, and many commands can
	be factored into an implementation with CMD() and AUTOMATE() wrappers
	to format input/output.
	* cmd.hh: Add stuff needed to define a new automate command.
	* cmd_automate.cc: This gets automate infrastructure similar to
	what commands.cc is for command-line commands. And automate stdio.
	* cmd_list.cc: "keys" and "certs" automate commands go here
	* automate.hh: No longer needed.
	* automate.cc: use AUTOMATE() macro for the automate commands that
	haven't got a new home yet.

2006-06-16  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* examples/display_branches.lua: Enhanced to display how many
	times each branch cert appeared.

2006-06-14  Alex Queiroz  <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* monotone.texi: Added a trick about reusing code from the default
	hooks using Lua closures.

2006-06-13  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* cmd_list.cc (ls_changed): roster friendly rewrite using existing
	select_nodes_modified_by_cset

2006-06-12  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* cmd_merging.cc (get_roster): allow no arguments and default to
	value in _MTN/revision
	* std_hooks.lua: switch temporary file names from mt.XXX to
	mtn.XXX; update attr function docs; add java class files to
	standard ignore hook

2006-06-11  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* po/it.po: Updated and translated a few more strings (68 to go).

2006-06-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Clear 2 fuzzies.  Change a %s to %d, corresponding to
	Lapo's change below.

	* database.cc: corrected a '%s' in a '%d', removed a couple of '\n'.
	* po/it.po: Updated and translated a few more strings (71 to go).

	* visualc/sqlite3.vcproj: Let SQLite build find our config.h.

2006-06-08  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* inodeprint.cc: convert to basic_io format. 
	Silently skips reading old format files, then writes
	out the new format as per usual. Old mtn versions
	have no format checking so will read the (nonsensical)
	new format file without errors.

2006-06-08  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* boost/format/feed_args.hpp: 0 needs to be unsigned.
	* vocab.cc: #undef EXTERN before #defining it again

	* po/sv.po: A new string to translate.

2006-05-29  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* std_hooks.lua (merge3_*_cmd): Make all the merge3 merge helpers
	check the returned exit code of the merge program and generate an
	error message if it fails.
	(execute_confirm): Don't output an error message, that's the
	caller's responsability.
	(merge3): Follow the way the check of exit code is done elsewhere.

2006-05-29  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* std_hooks.lua (merge3): Check the exit code from the merging
	program to detect failure.  We could do that by strictly checking
	if the output file exists, but since some programs, like meld,
	don't produce a specific output file, that method is unsafe.
	(execute_confirm): Check the exit code from the execute call,
	and tell the user if something went wrong.

	modern versions of IS.

	* contrib/color-logs.sh: Update to 'mtn'.
	* enumerator.{cc,hh}: Expose parent map, cache certs.
	* netsync.cc: Use caches in enumerator and refiners.
	* refiner.hh (local_item_exists): New helper.

2006-04-28  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* database.cc (query::query): Allow query to be constructed
	without an initial SQL command.
	* database.cc (database::complete): Replace use of boost::format
	with query; building the query.sql_cmd as we go.  Fixes potential
	SQL injection attacks.

2006-04-28  Alex Queiroz  <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* po/pt_BR.po: Translated even more strings.

2006-04-27  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>

	* selectors.cc (parse_selector): Change boost::char_separator to
	boost::escaped_list_separator to support branch names containing '/'.

2006-04-27  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* std_hooks.lua: Remove default validate_commit_message hook.

2006-04-27  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* hash_map.hh: Do things a little differently. Should make
	instantiating different types of hash_map (like merkle_tree.hh does)
	easier, slightly less dependent on the compiler/library. (Currently,
	this should mostly be useful in the .visualc8 branch.)
	* basic_io.hh cmd_list.hh rcs_file.cc rcs_import.cc unix/fs.cc: These
	wouldn't compile with g++/stlport. Add includes, replace a
	const_iterator with an iterator in rcs_import.cc
	* database.cc interner.hh merkle_tree.hh vocab.cc xdelta.cc: Adjust
	to match the new hash_map.
	Compile-tested on g++ and g++ with stlport. Won't link when using
	stlport, because my boost was compiled against g++'s normal stl.

2006-04-27  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>
	* monotone.texi: add a missing $ to a packet example, and an
	introductory paragraph to the section. From Jeronimo Pellegrini,
	with minor wording tweaks.

2006-04-27  Alex Queiroz  <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* po/pt_BR.po: Translated more strings.

2006-04-27  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* cmd_list.cc: missing using std::sort; broke build with stlport4

2006-04-26  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* netsync.cc (serve_connections): Cycle through all results before
	recalculating the probe. Netxx does not make this as simple as it
	should be.

2006-04-26  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* automate.cc:
	* cmd_diff_log.cc:
	* cmd_list.cc:
	* cmd_merging.cc:
	* cmd_ws_commit.cc:
	* commands.cc:
	* work.cc: use explicit temp_node_id_sources everywhere
	* tests/t_log_dir.at: remove stale comment

2006-04-25  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* cmd_*.cc: merge new restrictions changes in from commands.cc
	split
	* tests/t_log_dir.at: remove stale comment 
	* work.{cc,hh}(find_missing, find_unknown_and_ignored): move 
	these functions here from commands.cc split
	
2006-04-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (package_full_revision_raw.txt): Pass --root to our
	calls to mtn.

2006-04-25  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* restrictions.{cc,hh} (find_missing, find_unknown_and_ignored): move to...
	* work.{cc,hh}: ...here since these are not really restriction things
	* cmd_ws_commit.cc: sort includes and add work.hh to account for moves

2006-04-26  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* app_state.{cc,hh}: Overload set_restriction to take a path_set as
	the list of paths to restrict to.
	* cmd_ws_commit.cc: Use this to fix revert --missing.

2006-04-25  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* monotone.cc: --quiet forces --ticker=none
	* tests/t_quiet.at: Check that --quiet turns off tickers.
	* testsuite.at: Call it.

2006-04-25  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* lua.cc: There is now an "extract_classified_str" to go with
	"extract_str", which doesn't log the value of the returned string.
	Use this in hook_get_passphrase.
	* tests/t_no_log_password.at: Test that the passphrase is not logged.
	* testsuite.at: Call it.

2006-04-25  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* po/POTFILES.in: add cmd.hh and the cmd_*.cc files

2006-04-25  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* examples/000README.txt, examples/display_branches.lua: Start a
	directory of small examples and other cool things you can do with
	monotone.  Contrary to the contrib directory, these files can
	seldom be taken and used as they are, they usually need to get
	integrated into some other file.
	* debian/docs, debian/changelog: Make sure the examples directory
	end up inside Debian's standard documentation directory, and
	document this change.

2006-04-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi: Add Jeronimo to copyright holder list.
	* AUTHORS: And the contributor list.
	
2006-04-25  Jeronimo Pellegrini  <pellegrini@mpcnet.com.br>

	* monotone.texi (Using packets): New section, short tutorial
	showing how packets work.  (With some small fixups by Nathaniel.)

2006-04-25  Jeronimo Pellegrini  <pellegrini@mpcnet.com.br>

	* monotone.texi: Replace many references to 'monotone' with
	'mtn'.

2006-04-24  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* contrib/monotone.el (monotone-commit-complete): call line
	removal function by it's actual name

2006-04-24  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* cmd_diff_log.cc (log): remove --recursive option from log;
	directories are always recursive as with other restricted commands
	* tests/t_log_dir.at: account for recursive directories

2006-04-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (attr): Use get_base_and_current_roster_shape
	instead of doing a pointless workspace scan.

2006-04-23  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Clear a fuzzy.

2006-04-23  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org> &  Alex Queiroz <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* lua.cc (monotone_includedir_for_lua): Tweak a spelling mistake.
	Notified by Jeronimo Pellegrini <pellegrini@mpcnet.com.br>.

2006-04-23 Alex Queiroz <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* pt_BR.po: Fixed some fuzzy translations.

2006-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (fork_server): Make sure to append to already
	existing log file.

2006-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (fork_server): Redirect the logs of the sub-
	servers to log files instead of a pipe, and have the main
	process read that file instead of the pipe.
	(read_server_record): Complain about unrecognised commands, and
	continue processing.
	(reload_conffile): Parse the logdir command.  Complain about
	unrecognised commands, and continue processing.

2006-04-21 Alex Queiroz <alex@ventonegro.org>

	* Make clear in the "automate get_revision" documentation that
	path stanzas are grouped under the corresponding "old_revision" one.

2006-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (server::set_hosts, server::set_patterns):
	Explain a little more what is removed from what.

2006-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (server::set_hosts, server::set_patterns):
	Write a warning saying that existing entries with the same host
	or pattern are stripped of said host or pattern.
	(server::set_patterns): Erasing the list node that we're iterating
	on, then trying to go to the next node doesn't work.  Save the
	iterator, then increment it before erasing the node using the
	saved value.  No more segfaults.  This is the same fix as was done
	for server::set_hosts February 21st.

2006-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: A fuzzy updated

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.{cc,hh} cmd.hh cmd_*.cc Makefile.am: Split commands.cc into
	lots of smaller files. Current grouping is semi-arbitrary by other
	code called and general "what it does" concept.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* tests/t_hook_helpers.at: New file: test some of the helper functions
	for the lua hooks.
	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (commit): E() if the old end of a delta is missing.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* tests/t_ls_changed.at: Also check that it detects added files/dirs.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* tests/t_ls_epochs.at: New file: test "ls epochs" and
	"ls epochs <branch>"
	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* tests/t_checkout_heads.at: New file: checkout should fail if there
	are multiple heads.
	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2006-04-20  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* testsuite.at: NOT_ON_WIN32 seems to be broken. Fix it.

2006-04-19  Timtohy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (log): Make log accept --recursive, which makes
	"log dir" log revisions where anything under dir/ changes.
	* tests/t_log_dir.at: Remove XFAIL. Test logging at attr change.
	* tests/t_help.at: New file, test the "help" command.
	* tests/t_approve.at: New file, test the "approve" command.
	* testsuite.at: Add the new tests.

2006-04-19  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_mtn_ignore.at: Tweak test so it would have detected the
	broken .mtn-ignore error handling fixed in the last commit.

	* std_hooks.lua (ignore_file): Fix up error handling for
	non-existent .mtn-ignore files.

2006-04-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	This change was contributed by Shaun Jackman <sjackman@gmail.com>

	* debian/changelog: Add missing Debian releases.

	* debian/rules: From Debian bug report #334999: FTBFS on
	arm/hppa/m68k: please use g++-3.4

2006-04-17  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Fixed nœud spelling.

2006-04-15  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_pidfile_log_permissions.at: Minor tweak to last change.

	* tests/t_empty_env.at: Remove LD_LIBRARY_PATH test; it was
	causing the test to be skipped without good reason in too many
	environments.

	* tests/t_ls_branches.at: Tweak include and exclude patterns to
	avoid spurious glob expansion under MinGW.

	* tests/t_pidfile_log_permissions.at: Skip part of the test under
	MinGW since we can't get UNIX permissions to map to the particular
	NT permissions we'd need for this portion of the test.

2006-04-14  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* commands.cc (CMD(setup)): Make this a CMD_NO_WORKSPACE.  The
	reason is a use-case, when someone setup a new project as a
	subdirectory of another project, and forgot to give the database
	and branch for this new project, and thereby ended up having it
	be in the same database and branch as the parent directory.
	* tests/t_setup_workspace_in_workspace.at (setup in subdirectory),
	testsuit.at: Add a test for it.

2006-04-14  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* po/it.po: Corrected an error (some "help command" were translated).

2006-04-14  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* Makefile.am: Use sed instead of perl to add the stylesheet
	reference in HTML files.  Perl is not available in some systems
	by default so this avoids an extra build-time dependency.

2006-04-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* unix/process.cc (read_umask): New function.
	(make_executable): Use it.
	* tests/t_executable_umask.at, testsuite.at: New test.
	XFAILed, because of totally mysterious failure!

2006-04-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): Use the entire path leaf for prog_name,
	but strip ".exe" off if present.

2006-04-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* ui.cc (compose_count): Simplify for count/total ticks.  There's
	no need to calculate the maximum size every time, since
	write_ticks has a specific test with the exact same effect.
	(tick_write_count::write_ticks): Specialise the test for the
	count/total case, since we know the exact maximum and therefore
	don't need to make space for a ludicrously large number.

2006-04-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* ui.hh (struct ticker): Add a member count_size to hold the size
	of the tick count output and a method set_count_size to modify it.

	* ui.cc (compose_count): New function to compose the count string
	for a ticker.  The code was moved from...
	(write_ticks): ... here.  If the tick's count_size is zero, use
	compose_count to calculate the output string for a well chosen
	large number and use its size as a default initial count size.
	This is still updated dynamically if we get a count string size
	that's still larger, but it should happen very rarely (when we get
	a size of 1024 gibibytes or more, quite precisely).

2006-04-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_pidfile_log_permissions.at: Spelling.

2006-04-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: A few more fuzzies to change.

2006-04-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (fork_server): Set the C locale before
	executing monotone itself.  This is needed since usher is
	trying to interpret the first line of monotone output, and
	only understands the english message.

2006-04-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: "ls branches" changed to take a pattern.

2006-04-12  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>
	
	* commands.cc (pid_file::pid_file): Move check for open pidfile until
	after we attempt to open the file :).

2006-04-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_pidfile_log_permissions.at: New test to check that we
	fail properly if the specified pid or log file could not be
	opened.  Thanks to Matthew Nicholson for the bug report.
	* testsuite.at: Add it.
	* ui.cc (user_interface::redirect_log_to): Check that file is open.
	* commands.cc (pid_file::pid_file): Ditto.

2006-04-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* UPGRADE: Add a note that all certs will be re-issued, and all
	revids will change.

2006-04-12 Thomas Keller <me@thomaskeller.biz>
	* po/README: Added small HOWTO for new translations
	
2006-04-11  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* merkle_tree.hh: make merkle_table be a hash_map instead of a map.

2006-04-11  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (ls_branches): Allow "ls branches <pattern>".
	* tests/t_ls_branches.at: Test it.

2006-04-11  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (main): Small error.  When -m was parsed, it
	was saved as the path to mtn instead of its value.

2006-04-11  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* win32/make_io_binary.cc: Fix compile errors under MinGW.

2006-04-11  Henry Nestler  <Henry@BigFoot.de>

	* contrib/mtbrowse.sh: Binary call to mtn

2006-04-11  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* netxx/resolve_getaddrinfo.cxx (resolve_hostname): monotone might
	be compiled on a computer that has AI_ADDRCONFIG and run on one
	that doesn't understand that flag.  If the error EAI_BADFLAGS is
	returned, try again without AI_ADDRCONFIG.

2006-04-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc: Changed all reference to "monotone" to the new
	"mtn".  Submitted by Ethan Blanton <eblanton@cs.ohiou.edu>.

2006-04-09  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* paths.cc (file_path::file_path): MM() on source path.

2006-04-09  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* platform.hh (make_io_binary): new function, turn off textmode
	"\n"->"\r\n" translation on Windows
	* {win32,unix}/make_io_binary.cc: Implementations of said function.
	* commands.cc (automate): Use said function so our output doesn't get
	mangled. (Mostly important for "automate stdio".)
	* Makefile.am: Add the new files.

2006-04-09  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* restrictions.{cc,hh}: Audit use of node id sources, and make a
	number of functions take an explicit node_id_source argument.
	* roster.cc (make_roster_for_base_plus_cset): Also take an
	explicit node_id_source.
	* commands.cc, automate.cc: Update to match new calling conventions.

2006-04-09  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* std_hooks.lua (accept_testresult_change): s/MT/_MTN/, thanks to
	Alex Queiroz for the catch...

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Finish paragraph that stopped in the

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* configure.ac, debian/changelog, win32/monotone.iss: 
	* monotone.spec: Bump version number to 0.26.
	* NEWS: Insert release time.

2006-04-08  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (process_netsync_args): fix crash when calling netsync
	with an --exclude but no include argument.
	* tests/t_netsync_no_include.at: netsync with --exclude but no
	include should E(), not I().
	* testsuite.at: call it

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi: Several little content improvements, scattered
	throughout.
	(Automation): Document new rev and manifest formats.  Document new
	packet commands.
	* database_check.cc: Add a comment to warn people that there are
	detailed docs on this, so if they add new stuff they'll want to
	add new docs too.
	* automate.cc (automate_get_manifest_of, automate_get_revision):
	Re-sync docs to manual.
	(automate_packet_for_fdata): Fix copy/paste error in error
	message.

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netxx/resolve_gethostbyname.cxx (resolve_hostname): #ifdef out
	Win32-incompatible error reporting call.

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc, annotate.cc: Turn all ticker labels from _() to
	N_(), to match Benoît's changes to the ticker class.

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* AUTHORS: Add Thomas Keller.

2006-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (distcleancheck_listfiles): Third time's
	the... charm?

2006-04-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* monotone.cc: Oops, needed to include
	boost/filesystem/convenience.hpp too.

	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): Exclude .exe extension by using
	fs::basename rather than path.leaf().

2006-04-08  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* netxx/resolve_gethostbyname.cxx (resolve_hostname),
	* netxx/resolve_getaddrinfo.cxx (resolve_hostname): Include the
	error string associated with the error returned by getaddrinfo()
	and gethostbyname() in the exception text.

	* netsync.cc (serve_connections): When socket() fails in Netxx,
	it throws a Netxx::Exception rather than a
	Netxx::NetworkException, so we need to catch that as well.  This
	should solve the problems some have experienced when they don't
	have a IPv6 stack and try to run a IPv6-enabled monotone.

2006-04-08  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: A phrase was changed in command.cc...

2006-04-07  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: A few untranslated ones appeared.

2006-04-07  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Fixed a fuzzy.

2006-04-07  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Syntax tweak.  I bet this still won't work...

	* Makefile.am: Backticks don't nest, use $().

2006-04-07  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>

	* monotone.texi: Update more examples to reflect new program
	output for revisions and diffs and manifests.

2006-04-07  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* lua.cc, commands.cc: Tiny string cleanups.

	* Makefile.am (distcleancheck_listfiles): Fix up find(1) syntax.

2006-04-07  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>

	* monotone.texi: Correct a copy/paste error, bug #15708

2006-04-07  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>

	* figures/README: Revise to describe a better .png generation method
	* figures/{manifest,file-id-manifest-id,revision-chaining,revision}.png:
	Reregenerate accordingly	
	* figures/oo-figures.sxd: Source changes for the following:
	* figures/{local,general}-workflow: "working copy" to "workspace", MT to _MTN

2006-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (distcleancheck_listfiles): Another try at this...

2006-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (distcleancheck_listfiles): Attempt to teach
	distcheck that it's okay that distclean does not remove
	package_revision.txt and package_full_revision_dist.txt files.
	Untested, because the test is taking ages and I want to go to
	sleep, so good luck :-).

2006-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* figures/README: Add note on PNGs.
	* figures/{manifest,file-id-manifest-id,revision-chaining,revision}.png:
	Regenerate PNGs.
	
2006-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* figures/oo-figures.sxd: Sigh, accidentally discarded the changes
	I had to make since the fonts changed and the arrows/boxes became
	incorrect.  This redoes them, to approximately match the version
	used to generate the current pdf files.

2006-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* figures/README: More notes.
	* figures/oo-figures.sxd: No idea what changed about this file,
	don't care.
	* figures/{manifest,file-id-manifest-id,revision-chaining,revision}:
	Finally managed to get proper pdfs out of OpenOffice.  Committing
	now before I have a chance to screw things up.
	
2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* figures/README: New file.
	* figures/oo-figures.sxd: Write into the file the filename that
	each figure should be exported to.  I'll actually do the exports
	later...
	
2006-04-07  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* ui.{cc,hh}: Use untranslated ticker name as key in ui.tickers
	to prevent buggy translations from crashing monotone.

2006-04-07  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Fixed.

2006-04-07  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Replaced nice unicode arrows with long strings.

2006-04-07  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* monotone.cc: Remove libgen.h and basename(), replace with
	equivalent from boost::filesystem.

	* sqlite/*: Import SQLite 3.3.5.

	* tests/t_mtn_ignore.at: Shuffle the output grepping tests a bit
	to make failure cases more obvious.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (mostlyclean-local): Delete
	package_full_revision.txt, not package_full_revision_dist.txt.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>
	
	* monotone.texi: Fix up the ascii diagrams in the early sections
	to match current data formats.  Fix up sample output similarly.
	Fix even more places where we say "monotone" to refer to the
	command.
	* figures/oo-figures.sxd: Update graphical figures to match
	current data formats.
	
2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi: Fix a bunch more places where we say "monotone"
	to refer to the command name.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi: .mt-attrs?  Never heard of it...

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* po/LINGUAS: Add de.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Go ahead and add a note about sqlite 3.3, since
	incompatibility with the 3.2 command line client has apparently
	bitten at least two of us.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (package_full_revision_*.txt): Try this again,
	hopefully now 'distcheck' will work in a clean dir on systems that
	have no mtn binary.

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* UPGRADE: Expand and hopefully clarify 0.26 upgrading notes.
	Also add a paragraph at the top to explain how the file is
	organized (maybe this should have been there a long time ago...)

2006-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Complete (?) draft of 0.26 release notes.

2006-04-07  Satoru SATOH <ss@gnome.gr.jp>

	* po/ja.po: Updated Japanese translation.

2006-04-06  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* ui.cc (user_interface::output_prefix): Move the invariant
	checking that prog_name isn't empty...
	(user_interface::set_prog_name): here.  The reason is that an
	invariant generates a log, and that will generate another call
	to this message, which will trigger the invariant again, which
	generates a log, which...
	In user_interface::output_prefix, still check if prog_name is
	empty, and output something harmless if it is.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Start writing 0.26 release notes.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster.cc (unify_roster_oneway): Discover that this code is not
	really composable with arbitrary node_id_sources; add an assertion
	to document the real interface, and a comment explaining why this
	is the case, and why it is a problem for workspace merge and db
	check.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database_check.cc (check_sane): Remove dead code.

2006-04-05  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.cc: Make sure prog_name gets the basename of the
	program from argv[0], not the whole absolute path to it.

	* tests/t_commit_validate.at, tests/t_log_to_file.at: The monotone
	logs are prefixed with the program name ('mtn'), not with
	'monotone' any longer.

2006-04-05  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* mt_version.cc (get_version): Close the parenthesis.

	* po/sv.po: Fix a few fuzzy strings and translate a new one.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* sanity.cc (dump_buffer): Make the "discarding debug log"
	slightly more informative.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* ui.{cc,hh}: Use the prog_name in output.
	* app_state.cc (app_state::prog_name): Change default to 'mtn'.
	Set the global ui object's prog_name whenever our prog_name is
	set.
	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): Use the new prog_name setter.

2006-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): MM() our command line, LC_ALL, and full
	version, so that they are always included in dump and debug
	files.

2006-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* mt_version.{cc,hh} (get_version, get_full_version): New
	functions.  Also tweak --full-version output for readability.

2006-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* mt_version.cc (print_full_version): Include compiler
	vendor/version, c++ stdlib vendor/version, and boost version in
	--full-version output.

2006-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Yet another try at the package full revision stuff;
	hopefully this version still works just as well as the old
	versions, while also getting rid of the repeated "Generated from
	cached data" messages.

2006-04-05  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* po/it.po: Changed "in/out" translations as graphical arrows.

2006-04-04  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* tests/t_rosterify_empty_manifest.at: a test for rosterifying a db
	that has empty manifests

2006-04-04  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* revision.cc (construct_revisions_from_ancestry): all rosters must be
	given a root node, even if all files have been dropped.

2006-04-04  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* database.cc (database::dump): don't check schema of the db.

2006-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster.hh (class roster_t): Add massive comment about roster_t's
	location tracking stuff.  Conclusion: it is a little icky, but
	it's icky in an overly conservative way that doesn't cause any
	forseeable problems, so we'll leave it for now.

2006-04-04  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Updated and additional translations.

2006-04-02  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>

	* contrib/get_passphrase_from_file.lua: Added.  This hook reads
	passphrases from 'confdir/passphrases'.

2006-04-02  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>
	
	* contrib/ChangeLog.sh: Updated to reflect monotone name changes.

2006-04-02  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>

	* tests/t_pidfile.at: Added.  Test's pid file cleanup.
	* testsuite.at: Added new t_pidfile.at test.

2006-04-02  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* ui.cc (user_interface::redirect_log_to): Someone correctly
	pointed out that the log gets clobbered.  Now corrected.

2006-04-01  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* po/it.po: Translated a few more strings to Italian (170 to go).

2006-04-01  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* commands.cc (CMD(attr)): 2 more strings for I18N.

2006-04-01  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

2006-04-01  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* po/it.po: Translated a few more strings to Italian (205 to go).

2006-04-01  Petr Ovtchenkov  <ptr at island.corbina.net>

	* xdelta.cc: avoid dereference of iterators at end()

2006-03-31  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* work.cc (apply_delta): Don't print file hashes when updating.

2006-03-31  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (update): Print branch name when updating.

2006-03-30  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	"monotone not found" errors people have reported.

2006-03-30  Henry Nestler  <Henry@BigFoot.de>

	* mnt.1: '--bind' for serve on host, syntax from monotone.texi

2006-03-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* testsuite.at: Clean up the macros that call monotone a little.

2006-03-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Set date.

2006-03-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (package_revision.txt): Whoops, missed a few spots,
	thanks to Marcel for the tip...

2006-03-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* INSTALL: mtn-related tweaks.
	* monotone.spec, win32/monotone.iss: Untested mtn-related tweaks,
	and bump version to 0.26pre3.
	* debian/changelog: Bump version.
	
2006-03-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: First pass at entry for 0.26pre3.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* revision.cc (construct_revisions_from_ancestry): Convert
	.mt-ignore to .mtn-ignore.  We have always been at war with
	Oceania.
	* tests/t_rosterify_mt_ignore.at, testsuite.at: Test it.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* std_hooks.lua (ignore_file): Read .mtn-ignore, not .mt-ignore.
	* tests/t_mt_ignore.at, tests/t_add.at, testsuite.at: Adjust
	accordingly.
	* monotone.texi: Update accordingly.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

2006-03-28  Matthew Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>

	* contrib/monotone.bash_completion: Convert to use mtn instead of
	monotone.

2006-03-28  Lapo Luchini  <lapo@lapo.it>

	* AUTHORS: Added myself as translator.

	* po/it.po: Added Itailan translation.

2006-03-28  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/fr.po: Translation update.

	* po/sv.po: Translation update.

	* contrib/monotone-import.pl, contrib/monotone-import.pl: Change
	MT to _MTN.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_at_sign.at: Add a missing MTN_SETUP.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/README, testsuite.at, tests/*.at: First pass at updating
	tests for s/monotone/mtn/.  NB: new tests should use MTN_SETUP and
	MTN macros.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Build "mtn", not "monotone".
	* monotone.1: Rename to...
	* mtn.1: ...this.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/*_MT*: Rename to reflect that they now test _MTN, not MT.
	* testsuite.at: Update accordingly.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/*.at: s/MT/_MTN/.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* testsuite.at: s/MT/_MTN/.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi: s/.db/.mtn/ everywhere.  Also, s/MT:/MTN:/, and
	s/MT/_MTN/ as appropriate.
	* monotone.1: Likewise.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc (file_path): Use in_bookkeeping_dir when joining paths,
	instead of being clever.  It should be just about as fast, and
	means that there's only one code path that has to know how to
	detect bookkeeping dirs.
	* app_state.cc, automate.cc: Oops, forgot to hit save before.
	s/MT/_MTN/.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc (in_bookkeeping_dir): Argh.  Really correct now!
	Really!
	(test_split_join): Another cut-and-paste error.

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc (test_split_join): Whoops, be more careful
	copy-and-pasting within a single scope...
	(in_bookkeeping_dir): Was totally wrong, make all the constants
	correct...

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (CMD_NO_MT): Rename to...
	(CMD_NO_WORKSPACE): ...this.
	* *.cc, *.hh: s/MT/_MTN/ (mostly in comments).
	
2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (get_log_message_interactively): 
	* std_hooks.lua (edit_comment): s/MT:/MTN:/

2006-03-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc: s/MT/_MTN/ everywhere.
	(in_bookkeeping_dir): Also apply the security kluge from 0.25.2,
	where we define the bookkeeping dir case-insensitively.
	Add tests for this.

2006-03-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (check_format): Use .empty() instead of comparing
	.size() to zero, trivial style cleanup.
	(check_is_not_rosterified): New method.
	* revision.cc (build_changesets_from_manifest_ancestry) 
	(build_roster_style_revs_from_manifest_style_revs): Call it.
	* tests/t_rosterify_on_rosterified_db.at, testsuite.at: New test.

2006-03-27  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* idna/nfkc.c, popt/popt.c, popt/popt.h, popt/popthelp.c: Warning
	cleanups.

2006-03-25  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* diff_patch.cc, hash_map.hh, lua/lua.h, mkstemp.cc, monotone.cc,
	platform.hh, rcs_file.cc, sanity.hh, ui.cc, vocab.hh: config.h
	cleanups--ensure it is included before any other includes, and
	that we use "", rather than <>.

	* idna/version.c: Use STRINGPREP_VERSION rather than VERSION,
	which just happens to be defined to the monotone version number.

2006-03-24  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Corrected all the fuzzy translations
	* po/fr.po: Added some missing translations.

2006-03-24  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* database.cc (database::load): Analyze database after load.
	(database::execute): Minor whitespace cleanup.

2006-03-23  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* tests/t_update_off_branch.at: Instead of retrying the update
	by specifying the branch of the off-branch revision, check that
	the branch specified in MT/options has changed automagically to
	the intended revision's branch.

2006-03-22  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* database.{cc,hh}: Report page size and default cache size in 'db
	info' output.

2006-03-22  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* key_store.cc (consume_key_pair, read_key_dir) 
	(ensure_in_database, write_key): Add some logging.

2006-03-22  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc (CMD(update)): update the workspace branch
	to match a revision given with -r.

2006-03-22  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* schema_migration.cc, database.cc: print a more helpful
	error message when we fail in calculate_schema_id() (usually
	because of locking). Don't bother telling the user what the
	sqlite error number is (but still log it).

2006-03-20  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* configure.ac: Fix Windows identification test so that it doesn't
	pass unexpected under Cygwin.  Reported by Lapo Luchini.

2006-03-20  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* configure.ac: use test -f rather than test -e, since Solaris's
	/bin/sh doesn't have the latter.

2006-03-19  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Tidier versions of html and monotone.html targets,
	thanks to Thomas Moschny for the patch.

2006-03-18  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* automate.cc (automate_inventory): Add an MM().

	* Makefile.am: Copy figures/ into two places for html target, and
	don't attempt to copy std_hooks.lua over itself if we're building
	in the src dir.

2006-03-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am (html): For the html target, figures/ and
	std_hooks.lua should always be copied.  Making it conditional
	should only be done for the monotone.html target.

2006-03-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am (monotone.html, html): Only copy figures/ and
	std_hooks.lua if the builder is in a separate build directory.

2006-03-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* tests/t_netsync_notes.at: Enhance the test by checking that a
	netsync where no data is written to the database won't trigger
	the note_netsync* hooks.

2006-03-18  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Fix a couple of cases where documentation was
	failing to build.  If you're building outside of the source dir we
	need to copy figures/ and std_hooks.lua into the build dir.

	* win32/monotone.iss: Include zlib1.dll in installer package.

	* tests/t_empty_env.at: Copy zlib1.dll into the current directory
	like we have to for libiconv-2.dll.  While here, add a check for
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH and cause the test to be skipped if it is set.

	* tests/t_netsync_notes.at: Canonicalise output in a few places so
	that the test passes on CRLF platforms.

2006-03-18  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* netsync.cc (session): Only call the note_netsync hooks if
	something has been written to the database.  The reason is that
	if those hooks are called from a server process and those hooks
	are used to update another database (say, for viewmtn), it means
	another run will be done with monotone to pull from the server,
	which would trigger another call to the hooks, which would cause
	another pull, which would cause those hooks to be called again,
	...

2006-03-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* tests/t_netsync_notes.at: New test to check that the
	note_netsync hooks work as they should.
	* testsuite.at: Add the above test as well as the following
	useful macros.
	(BASE_MANIFEST): Gives the manifest identity of the base
	revision.
	(WORKING_MANIFEST): Gives the manifest identity of the workspace.
	(CERTVALUE): Picks out the value of a specific cert from a given
	revision.
	(DATA): Like AT_DATA, but allows environment variables to be
	expanded in the resulting file.
	(NETSYNC_SETUP_WITH_NOTES): A variant of NETSYNC_SETUP that adds
	note_netsync hooks.

2006-03-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* lua.cc, lua.hh (lua::hookshook_note_netsync_revision_received,
	lua::hookshook_note_netsync_cert_received,
	lua::hookshook_note_netsync_pubkey_received): Change them so nonce
	comes last.  It means that hooks written for the older inteface
	(the once without nonce) will work transparently.
	* monotone.texi (Hooks): Change the docs accordingly.
	* netsync.cc (session::~session): Change the calls accordingly.

2006-03-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	There are times when it is good to be able to prepare for a
	bunch of calls to note_netsync* hooks, as well as to know when
	there are not more such calls to be expected.  To that end, I've
	added note_netsync_start and note_netsync_end, and changed the
	others to take the exact same nonce as those two.  The purpose
	of the nonce is to differentiate between different runs, if they
	ever would run in parallel.

	* lua.cc, lua.hh (lua_hooks::hook_note_netsync_start,
	lua_hooks::hook_note_netsync_end): Added methods.
	(lua_hooks::hook_note_netsync_revision_received,
	lua_hooks::hook_note_netsync_pubkey_received,
	lua_hooks::hook_note_netsync_cert_received): Modified to take a
	nonce.
	* monotone.texi (Hooks): Documented.
	* netsync.cc (session::~session): Modified to call
	app.lua.hook_note_netsync_start and app.lua.hook_note_netsync_end
	as well as the others with the nonce argument.

2006-03-16  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* commands.cc (log): Don't include <sys/time.h>, my mistake.

2006-03-16  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* revision.cc (construct_revisions_from_ancestry): Linguistics:
	Close a parenthesis.
	* po/sv.po: Translation update.

2006-03-15  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* diff_patch.cc (unidiff_hunk_writer::advance_to,
	cxtdiff_hunk_writer::advance_to): Because ctx is a size_t, make
	everything dealing with it a size_t as well.  Keeps the compiler
	quiet...

2006-03-15  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* database.cc (db::load), schema.sql: PRAGMA page_size=8192

2006-03-13  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* tests/t_serve_ignores_mt_options.at: New test to check that
	'monotone serve' really ignores the contents of an available
	MT/options.
	* testsuite.at: Use it.

2006-03-12  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* netsync.cc (session::maybe_note_epochs_finished): only begin the
	other refinements if we're the client, as per the comment in refiner.cc

2006-03-14  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* revision.cc (construct_revisions_from_ancestry): Now with 17%
	more helpfulness.

2006-03-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	Some of the monotone commands don't really need to use the data
	in MT/options.  As a matter of fact, it's even a really bad idea
	for some command, for example 'monotone serve'.  We must still
	check for the MT directory and read whatever is there, just
	don't immediately use the data from MT/options.  I've done it by
	moving the code that processes the data from MT/options in
	app_state::allow_workspace to another method, which is then used
	separately.

	* app_state.cc, app_state.hh (app_state::allow_workspace): The
	code that processes data from MT/options and uses the information
	is now moved...
	(app_state::process_options): ... here.

	* commands.cc (struct command, commands::process, CMD, CMT_NO_MT):
	Add a per-command flag that says if the particular command needs
	to bother with the workspace options or not.  CMD_NO_MT is a new
	macro to help define commands that don't.
	(CMD(serve)): Change into...
	(CMD_NO_MT(serve)): ... this.

	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): Changed the comment so it matches
	reality.

2006-03-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_dump_load.at: Don't canonicalise database dump output;
	there should be no need to do so.

2006-03-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi (Selectors): Remove line noise.
	Also, add an example for c:.
	
	* roster.cc (update_restricted_roster_from_filesystem): Put back
	hint about drop --missing, revert --missing that was lost in
	transition to rosters.

2006-03-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* configure.ac: Add a second sync_for_stdio test to work around a
	bug in OS X.

	* testsuite.at: Changes to Perl and Python UNB64_COMMAND
	invocations to work around some quoting issues broken/revealed in
	my last change.

2006-03-12  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* commands.cc: log: retrieve changes summary and ancestors only when
	needed.

2006-03-12  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Small fixes.

2006-03-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* paths.cc, annotate.cc, xdelta.cc: Fix the signed vs unsigned
	warnings which have obvious solutions.

	* testsuite.at: Remove eval in UNB64_COMMAND and UNGZ_COMMAND; it
	breaks testsuite tracing.

	* tests/t_database_check.at, tests/t_rosterify_attrs.at,
	tests/t_rosterify_rename.at: Use POSIX syntax for tail.

2006-03-12  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* ChangeLog: Fixup after merge lossage.

2006-03-11  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* m4/prog_cxx_warnings.m4: Turn on extra warnings (-W) when using
	GCC.  Also disable 'unused variable' warnings (enabled by -W) for
	now.  This change only causes 8 new warnings (all of one
	type--signed vs unsigned) to occur.

	* netxx/peer.cxx, netxx/sockaddr.cxx, netxx/sockaddr.h: Correct
	the only six cases of type punning that occur (that GCC 4.1 can
	detect, at least) in C++ code we compile.  It is probably safe to
	remove -fno-strict-aliasing from CXXFLAGS now.

2006-03-11  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Fixed encoding.

2006-03-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	bit tired...

2006-03-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/fr.po: More translations done.

2006-03-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	translations added.

2006-03-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/fr.po: More translations done.  Note that I changed the
	translation "cert" -> "cert" to "cert" -> "certif" because I
	found a previous translation of the latter kind and liked it
	better.

2006-03-08  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/fr.po: Translating more untranslated strings.

2006-03-08  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Traduce 2 new strings.

2006-03-08  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* testsuite.at: call it

2006-03-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_sink_has_extra_epochs.at: Er, and also check for branch
	names rather than revisions in the output of 'ls branches'.

	* tests/t_sink_has_extra_epochs.at: Fix up subtle syntax error.

	* lru_cache.h: Rename some enums to avoid namespace collisions on
	Win32.

	* tests/t_disapprove_branch.at: Actually add.

2006-03-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_disapprove_branch.at, testsuite.at: Add a placeholder
	test for disapprove's broken branch handling; from code
	inspection, it is obviously broken.  I don't have time to write a
	real test right now, though, never mind fix it... but at least we
	have an XFAIL and a comment...

2006-03-07  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* std_hooks.lua (ignore_file): Fixup after introduction of
	dir_matches() helper.  Visual SourceSafe stores metadata in named

	* tests/t_push_with_upstream_epochs.at: Test that we don't hang on a
	one-way transfer where the sink has extra epochs.
	* testsuite.at: call it
	* tests/t_epoch.at: When we're setting epochs by hand, also try one
	with an invalid length. It should N(), not I().

2006-03-05  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (db set_epoch): N() on the epoch size, so we don't I()
	on it in database.cc .
	* netsync.cc (maybe_note_epochs_finished): If we're in source_role,
	epochs can be finished even if the refiner says we still have some
	to receive.
	* refiner.cc (begin_refinement): Add logging.

2006-03-05  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/fr.po: Add a translation guide, partly borrowed from
	subversion, work on a translation update, partly done.
	(this is done with Benoît's blessing)

2006-03-05  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* commands.cc (CMD(tag)): "revision version" seems a bit
	redundant.
	* po/sv.po: change the translation accordingly.

2006-03-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi (Hooks): Update merge2 and merge3 hook
	documentation to reflect current reality.

2006-03-05  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* work.cc: Remove single quotes from the new adding, dropping, and
	renaming messages to make them consistent with the existing update
	message.

	* tests/t_bad_packets.at: adapt for 0.26 and for the changes above

2006-03-02  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* work.{cc,hh} (perform_additions): Use boolean flag to indicate
	whether the paths should be treated as a set of starting points

2006-02-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* schema_migration.cc (migrate): Provide a little more feedback

2006-02-26  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	Add a new command, merge_into_dir, to allow a project to include an
	unrelated project as a subdir. Also add a show_conflicts command that
	performs a dry-run merge and prints conflict counts.
	* commands.cc: new commands, merge_into_dir and show_conflicts
	* commands.cc (propagate): remove duplicated code; this now calls
	merge_into_dir with a dir of '' (the empty string).
	* monotone.texi: Document the new commands.

2006-02-27  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	to avoid including ignored dirs such as '.svn', since dirs now

2006-02-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster_merge.cc: Update notes on tests.

2006-02-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* work.cc (attach_node): Apparently the tests depend on update
	clobbering existing non-versioned files... and we don't have a
	good solution _anyway_, so just go back to clobbering them.

2006-02-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* cset.cc (root_dir_test, invalid_csets_test): Don't test that

2006-02-24  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	should now be possible to use an usher to redirect connections based

	unused/unimplemented netcmd::netcmd(u8 version).

2006-02-24  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* commands.cc (ls_changed): I was a bit overly paranoid about the
	possibilities with C++ and defined an explicit functor for the set
	instead of relying on the automatic generation of less<file_path>.
	Derek Scherger made me realise I was a bit overzealous, and this
	change removes the explicit functor.

2006-02-23  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* enumerator.hh: Another GCC 4.1 compile fix.

	* tests/t_log_selectors.at: UnXFAIL.

	* restrictions.{cc,hh}: preliminary support for excludes and unit
	tests to see if it works

2006-02-13  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* app_state.{cc,hh}: 
	* globis.{cc,hh}: make exclude_patterns a vector rather than a
	set so that restriction includes/excludes are of the same type

2006-02-21  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* work.cc (detach_node): This time for sure!

2006-02-21  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

2006-02-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc (server::set_hosts): Erasing the list node that
	we're iterating on, then trying to go to the next node doesn't
	work.  Save the iterator, then increment it before erasing the
	node using the saved value.  No more segfaults.

2006-02-21  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	locking race in this test that is causing spurious failures by

	"marking" name.
	
2006-02-19  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster.{hh,cc} (testing_node_id_source): Make this node source
	available to unit tests in other files.
	* roster_merge.cc (test_roster_merge_node_lifecycle): New test.
	Still quite ugly.

2006-02-18  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster_merge.cc (roster_merge): Remove obsolete FIXME.

2005-10-19  Matthew A. Nicholson  <matt@matt-land.com>

	* testsuite.at: Add t_db_kill_rev_locally_2.at.

	source.  The version committed in the 3.3.4 import had a bunch of
	duplicate entries.

	* commands.cc (CMD(identify)): This isn't really a "workspace"
	command--stick it under "debug" for lack of a better place.

	* commands.cc (CMD(refresh_inodeprints)): Check for a valid
	workspace rather than failing with an invariant when run outside
	of a workspace.

	* tests/t_revert_new_project.at: Add an XFAIL test for a bug where
	reverting a file added in a new project will leave the workspace
	in a bad state until MT/work is removed manually.

	* testsuite.at: Add t_revert_new_project.at.

	* app_state.cc, app_state.hh, commands.cc, monotone.cc,
	options.hh: Add '--no-files' option to log to allow users to
	exclude the list of files changed in each revision from the log
	output.

	* monotone.texi: Document '--no-files', and '--next' and '--diffs'
	while there.

2006-02-17  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* lua.cc, lua.hh, monotone.texi, std_hooks.lua, test_hooks.lua,
	testsuite.at: Remove unused non_blocking_rng_ok hook.

	* sqlite/*: Import SQLite 3.3.4.

2006-02-16  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* netsync.cc (handle_new_connection): Netxx::Address.get_name()
	returns NULL every now and then. if so, continue with "" instead

	* sqlite/parse.c: move #line under all #include directives so
	the compiler can't be confused by it.

2006-02-14  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am (htmldir): Add variables so monotone.html is created
	and installed automatically.
	This is prompted by debian/monotone.html, which indicates
	monotone.html should be available.

	* netsync.cc (serve_connections): Correct spelling.

2006-02-13  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* sanity.cc (sanity::dump_buffer): Fix a SEGV when we're in an
	error unwind and about to ask the user to mail us the crash
	log--we must use FL() rather than F() here, since by the time this
	is called we can't rely on the i18n infrastructure being alive.

2006-02-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc (serve_connections): Revert garbage that I
	accidentally checked in last time...

2006-02-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Add things done since last time I did this...

2006-02-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* {cset,paths,revision,roster,sanity,vocab}.{cc,hh}: GCC 4.1
	compile fixes.

2006-02-11  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* NEWS: Removed my notice about netsync, as I just noticed it
	was already mentioned under Bugs:.

2006-02-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* configure.ac, debian/changelog, monotone.spec:
	* win32/monotone.iss: Bump version to 0.26pre2.

2006-02-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Draft for 0.26pre2.

2006-02-11  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* netsync.cc (serve_connections): Enclose more or less everything
	in a try-catch block to catch if using IPv6 failed, and to try
	with just IPv4 in that case.  This is important for those who
	copy a IPv6-enabled binary to a system that doesn't use IPv6.

	* po/sv.po: Adapt translation to the newly changed messages.

2006-02-10  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* tests/t_drop_missing.at:
	* tests/t_rename.at:

	remove some unrequired \n's
	
2006-02-10  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* netsync.cc (process_anonymous_cmd, process_auth_cmd): don't
	report misleading permission denied errors for branches that are
	not being served
	* paths.cc (find_and_go_to_workspace): delete stale comment
	* tests/t_netsync_permissions.at: add test pull of branch that is
	not served

2006-02-11  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	Adding your db is silly and confusing (what should revert do?).
	So, it's not allowed any more (the db file is ignored, regardless of
	what the ignore hook says).
	* tests/t_add_owndb.at: remove XFAIL, use 'ls known' instead of
	'ls unknown'
	* testsuite.at: don't put the db in the ignore hook
	* database.{cc,hh}: is_dbfile(), check if a path is the database file
	* work.cc: check is_dbfile where we check the ignore hook when
	walking the filesystem
	* tests/t_mt_ignore.at: fix for having the db always be ignored

2006-02-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.texi (Hooks): Change the example for
	get_revisions_cert_trust to check "branch" certs instead of
	"ancestor" ones, and thereby match the effect of the "approve"
	command.

2006-02-10  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc (CMD(checkout)): wrapping in a transaction makes
	a big difference.

2006-02-09  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (SQLITE_SOURCES): Remove header files lost in
	latest SQLite upstream import.

2006-02-09  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* lua.cc (hook_validate_commit_message): make validated the
	default.

2006-02-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* tests/t_cvsimport.at, tests/t_cvsimport3.at,
	tests/t_cvsimport_deleted_invar.at,
	tests/t_cvsimport_manifest_cycle.at, tests/t_cvsimport_samelog.at,
	tests/t_singlecvs.at: Changed to cope with the strictness of
	CVSNT.  It doesn't create a CSVROOT/history file automagically,
	but CVSROOT/modules is created automatically both by the older CVS
	and by CVSNT.  You can't check out a group of files using revision
	numbers with CVSNT.  You MUST stand in the work directory for some
	command with CVSNT.  Finally, with CVSNT, 'cvs init' generates the
	following message if you're a normal user, at least on Debian:

	cvs init: Unable to register repository.
	cvs init: Your login may not have sufficient permissions to modify the
	cvs init: global server settings.
	cvs init: Repository /home/levitte/cvsfoo initialised

2006-02-09  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* testsuite.at: Remove duplicate line.

2006-02-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Adjust for new and removed files in import.
	* NEWS: Make a note of the SQLite database format change.
	* database.cc (database::load): Rewrite so that we don't need any
	local changes to SQLite.

2006-02-08  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* testsuite.at, tests/t_ls_changed.at: News test, for "list
	changed".

	* monotone.texi, monotone.1: Document "list changed".

	* po/sv.po: Correct translations of changed messages, translate
	new messages.

	* commands.cc (ls_changed, CMD(list)): Add a new command, "list
	changed", to list changed files, always sorted in lexical order.

2006-02-06  Blake Kaplan  <mrbkap@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc CMD(commit): Call a new lua hook to validate the commit
	message. Don't ignore -m "" when it's passed on the command line.
	* lua.cc, lua.hh: Add a new hook that validates a given commit message
	and passes in the added files, deleted files, and modified files.
	* std_hooks.lua: Give a default hook to validate commit messages. This
	currently disallows empty messages, as monotone currently does.

2006-02-05  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* ui.cc (tick_write_count::write_ticks): Reverted lexical_cast,
	back to F().

2006-02-05  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* ui.cc (tick_write_count::write_ticks): Fixed utf8 handling.
	boost::format + locale sucks, it ouputs "1\u+ffff24" for
	"%d" % 1024.

2006-02-02  Emile Snyder  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>

	* merge.cc (resolve_merge_conflicts): If the merge has non-content
	conflicts warn the user and abort before making them do content
	merges.  Move logging/warning of conflicts to methods in the
	roster_merge_result struct.

	* roster_merge.{cc,hh} (log_conflicts,
	warn_non_content_conflicts): New methods to do the busy work of
	logging or warning.

2006-02-02  Emile Snyder  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>

	* netsync.cc (run_netsync_protocol): Print a warning if either the
	include or the exclude branch pattern have a ' or a " character
	anywhere in them.  Hopefully will help users running in a Windows
	shell when they do: monotone sync myserver 'mybranch*' and nothing
	happens because the ' characters are passed in to monotone.
	
2005-01-30  Emile Snyder  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>

	* annotate.cc: (do_annotate) Add ticker for revisions processed to
	annotate command.
	
2006-01-29  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Update a few translations, leave a number of fuzzy
	ones until we've decided how "workspace" should be translated.

2006-01-27  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* *: Use the term 'workspace' consistently throughout monotone for
	the concept we previously described interchangably using the two
	terms 'working copy' and 'working directory'.  This change has
	been made everywhere except in historical documentation (NEWS and
	ChangeLog).

2006-01-27  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.texi (Generating Keys): Correct small type, the keys
	are not stored in /home/jim/.monotone/monotonerc.

2006-01-26  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* app_state.{cc,hh}: 
	* commands.cc (log): 
	* monotone.cc: 
	* options.hh: allow --next to view upcoming changes
	* tests/t_log_depth.at: rename to ...
	* tests/t_log_last_next.at: ... this since log now uses
	--last/--next and not --depth
	* testsuite.at: rename t_log_depth.at to t_log_last_next.at
	
2006-01-27  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* monotone.texi: Clean up 'serve' syntax in a couple of places.

2006-01-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi (Generating Keys, Network Service Revisited):
	Clean up some key-related stuff -- genkey doesn't need a db, so
	don't confuse the reader by giving it one, and update the sample
	output too.

2006-01-27  Stéphane Gimenez <dev@gim.name>

	* sanity.hh: fix scoping issue revealed by gcc-4.1.

2006-01-26  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* INSTALL: mention --enable-pch

2006-01-25  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* po/sv.po: Fix all fuzzy translations (some needed no fix).
	Translate the last untranslated ones.

2005-01-24  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	Make a netsync client crash not hang the testsuite.
	* tests/t_netsync_single.at: use netsync macros
	* testsuite.at: Make NETSYNC_SETUP set a trap on exit to kill
	any servers.

2005-01-24  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (update): Remove fixme comment.

2005-01-24  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (update): Allow backwards/sideways updates.
	tests/t_update_to_revision.at: remove XFAIL

2006-01-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.{cc,hh}: Clean up code formatting a bit, rename some
	variables, rely more on automatic conversion.

2006-01-24  Vinzenz Feenstra <evilissimo@c-plusplus.de>
	
	* query_args.hh: Introduced struct query_args and struct
	query_args_param. Used to typesafe arguments for database::execute
	and database::fetch

	argument style via operator% which is more typesafe.

	use rosters

	changelog certs from the last n revisions and prints them in standard
	ChangeLog format.
	* contrib/edit_comment_from_changelog.lua: an edit_comment hook that
	takes the initial commit message from the most recent ChangeLog entry

2006-01-23  Henry Nestler  <henry@bigfoot.de>

	* monotone.texi, monotone.1: Mode none for --ticker.

2006-01-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	from AC_TRY_RUN to AC_TRY_COMPILE.  Also a couple of other minor
	cleanups.
	* Makefile.am: Remove win32/wcwidth.c from WIN32_PLATFORM_SOURCES.

2006-01-21  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	revisions table, so we don't trigger the has-revisions-but-no-rosters
	check.

2006-01-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

2006-01-18  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* LINGUAS: Change sv_SE to just sv.
	* po/sv_SE.po: Rename ...
	* po/sv.po: ... to this, as there aren't so many dialects.  Update
	with more strings to translate.

	* std_hooks.lua: xgettext whines about a missing quote, so add
	one.

2006-01-15  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster.cc (test_unify_rosters_end_to_end): Add failing test for
	unify_roster's handling of attr corpses.
	
2006-01-15  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* cert.cc (load_key_pair): 
	* keys.cc (require_password): Use accessor method, so as to
	actually compile...

2006-01-15  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* ui.cc: make tickers saner (203 K vs 0.2 M). 
	Print full byte counts below 1 K.

2006-01-14  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* lua.cc (hook_get_key_pair): Remove.
	* keys.cc (require_password): Adjust accordingly.
	* cert.cc (priv_key_exists, load_key_pair): Likewise.

2006-01-14  Christof Petig <christof@petig-baender.de>

	* database.cc, database.h: binary transparent infrastructure,
	store and retrieve former base64 encoded columns as BLOBs

	* schema_migration.cc: unbase64 changed columns, change comment
	on files.data which indicates a different database format

	* schema.sql: change comment on file which indicates, that
	files.data is no longer base64 encoded

2006-01-14  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* configure.ac: Make sure there's an empty xgettext.opts
	when xgettext accepts --flag.  This avoids getting an error
	message later on when cat can't find it to append to
	po/Makefile.in.

	* po/LINGUAS, po/sv_SE.po: New Swedish translation.  Needs
	reviewing at this stage.

2006-01-13  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone-notify.pl: Make it possible for the user to say what
	the monotone binary is called or where it is.  Adapt to revision
	output changes and to changes in the monotone UI.

2006-01-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* po/Makevars (XGETTEXT_OPTIONS): This time for sure!

2006-01-13  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	has not been rosterified.

2006-01-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* po/Makevars (XGETTEXT_OPTIONS): More fiddling to make
	intltool-update happy.

2006-01-13  Bruce Stephans  <monotone@cenderis.demon.co.uk>

	* lua.cc (shared_trust_function_body): Index lua arrays
	from 1, not 0.

2006-01-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* sanity.cc (dump_buffer): Add forgotten newline.

2006-01-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* roster.cc (make_roster_for_merge): Add more MM()'s.

2006-01-12  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* contrib/{color-logs.{conf,sh},monotone.el}: Changes to handle
	renaming of --no-merges.
	* app_state.{cc,hh}, commands.cc, monotone.cc, options.hh: Make
	'log' default to not displaying merges.  Rename '--no-merges'
	option to '--merges'.

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (diff): gettext'ify the "no changes" tag.

2006-01-11  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am: Add contrib/usher as an extra program.  This works
	as a reminder that this program exists, and provides supported
	ways to build it.

	* contrib/usher.cc: Add a -m switch, to be able to specify the
	name or complete path of/to the monotone binary, in case there
	are several floating around on the system.

2006-01-11  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am: pch.hh should be included

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* sanity.hh (struct i18n_format): Make internationalized format
	strings and non-internationalized format strings type-distinct.
	(This hopefully sets up for fixing some of the charset mess later
	down the road.)
	(FL): New macro; like F but without the i18n glue.
	Use FL with L, and F/FP with everything else.
	* *.hh, *.cc: Adjust existing F/L/etc. usage accordingly.

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* HACKING: Add section listing all the single-character macros.

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (fetch): Don't log all SQL unless requested by
	user.

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* po/Makevars (XGETTEXT_OPTIONS):
	* configure.ac: Tweak xgettext configuration to make intltool
	happier.

2006-01-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc (process_confirm_cmd): Remove.

2006-01-11  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* platform.hh, win32/wcwidth.c: Remove local wcswidth
	implementation--it's no longer needed.

2006-01-10  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* tests/t_revert_unchanged.at: new test to check that reverting
	nothing but unchanged files doesn't end up with an empty
	restriction and revert everything
	* testsuite.at: call it

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* packet.cc (packet_roundabout_test): Test rdata packets too.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc (session): 
	* commands.cc (read): Adjust to match previous change.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* packet.{hh,cc} (struct packet_db_writer): Remove old guard
	against accidentally ingesting public keys -- this has not been
	useful for some years.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* diff_patch.hh (struct content_merger): Oops, forgot to remove
	the merge2 prototype.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* std_hooks.lua: 
	* lua.cc (hook_merge2): 
	* diff_patch.cc (try_to_merge_files): Remove merge2 code, since we
	no longer do merge2's.  (We can always revive it if we add suture
	support.)

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* packet.cc (consume_file_delta): Remove unused 4-argument form.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	(hook_resolve_dir_conflict): Remove dead code.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_selectors_b_h.at, testsuite.at: New test.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (manifest_cert_exists, put_manifest_cert): 
	(get_manifest_cert, get_manifest_certs): Remove unused methods.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (put_reverse_version, put_file_reverse_version):
	Whoops, missed some dead code.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* revision.cc (build_roster_style_revs_from_manifest_style_revs):
	Remove unused variable; silence gcc warning.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* packet.cc (consume_file_reverse_delta) 
	(struct feed_packet_consumer): Remove support for nonexistent
	"frdelta" packet type.

	* key_store.cc (struct keyreader): Remove obsolete methods.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	(delta_exists): Remove unused 3-argument version.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (database::rehash): Likewise.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* change_set.{cc,hh}: Remove.

2006-01-10  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* contrib/ciabot_monotone.py (Monotone.get_revision): Update to
	use 'automate get_revision' instead of 'cat revision'.

2006-01-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* lua.cc (monotone_parse_basic_io_for_lua): Don't trust the
	returned value from lua_tostring() to stick around.  Instead, copy
	it into a regular std::string.
	* std_hooks.lua (get_netsync_read_permissions,
	get_netsync_write_permissions): Make sure to properly close the
	permission files.

2006-01-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/usher.cc, monotone.1, monotone.cc, po/fr.po, po/ja.po,
	po/pt_BR.po, testsuite.at: Change the default port from 5253 to
	4691 (assigned to us by IANA).

2006-01-07  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* schema_migration.cc: add safe-guard against passing a null pointer
	into string handling. (necessary with sun studio)

2006-01-05  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	restrictions
	* restrictions.hh: add a comment about restricted command
	consistency

2005-12-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Write up for 0.25.

2005-12-29  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* sqlite/{pager.c,sqlite3.h}: Upgrade to SQLite 3.2.8.

2005-12-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Notes on what to write up for 0.25.
	* win32/monotone.iss, monotone.spec, debian/changelog:
	* configure.ac, UPGRADE: Bump.

2005-12-26  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc (CMD(revert)): revert with no args prints usage,
	mention "." for entire working copy.

2005-12-21  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc (dump_difs, CMD(log)): only print --diffs for the file
	of interest.

2005-12-21  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* botan/es_capi.{cpp,h}: Windows compile fixes for Botan 1.4.10.

2005-12-21  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* upgrade to Botan 1.4.10

2005-12-20  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>

	* monotone.texi: Rearrange the description of monotone serve into
	two sections; the first one describing basic steps necessary to
	get Jim and the reader through to the next sections, and a later
	more advanced section that discusses some of the subleties and
	choices and moves them on to running a dedicated server.  Other
	small tweaks in nearby sections while here.

2005-12-18  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* AUTHORS: Add Roland.

2005-12-17  Roland McGrath  <roland@redhat.com>

	* work.hh (struct file_itemizer): Remove extraneous qualifier on
	visit_file declaration.
	* app_state.hh (class app_state): Remove extraneous qualifier on
	set_restriction declaration.

2005-12-14  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* win32/fs.cc: Handle the fact that the MoveFileEx symbol might
	exist in kernel32.dll even though it doesn't actually work.  It
	turns out that Win9x implements a bunch of NT-only symbols as
	stubs that return ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED, so it's not
	sufficient to detect feature availability by doing symbol lookups
	at runtime.  Also add a missing parameter to the final error
	message.  Fixes #15063.

2005-12-13  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* commands.cc (update): remove \n from F() string
	(revert): display "reverting..." messages similar to update
	* tests/t_revert.at: allow output from revert

2005-12-13  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* testsuite.at: Use SIGTERM rather than SIGSEGV to close down
	monotone servers.
	* HACKING, tests/README: Remove references to use of SEGV for
	terminating monotone servers.

2005-12-13  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* constants.cc: New netsync is incompatible, bump protocol version.
	* constants.hh: Change default port to the one IANA assigned us.

2005-12-10  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* roster.cc (make_roster_for_merge): unshadow the node_id_source
	argument. Resolve usages to the argument or the local by educated guess.

2005-12-10  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* paths.{cc,hh}: operator<() for split_path's

2005-12-10  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* sanity.{cc,hh}: Fix musing dumps so that the header line always gets
	printed, even if printing the body throws an exception.
	* database.cc, packet,cc, revision.cc: sprinkle MMs
	* cset.cc: sanity check print_cset to match parse_cset

2005-12-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* po/pt_BR.po: Add missing newline.
	* AUTHORS: Add Alex Queiroz to list of translators.

2005-12-08  Alex Queiroz  <asandroq@gmail.com>

	* po/pt_BR.po: Beginnings of the Brazilian Portuguese translation.
	* po/LINGUAS: Add it.

2005-12-06  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* packet.cc (packet stream reading): Fix handling of privkey packets.
	It would convert pubkey+privkey to keypair, but not change the private
	key to the new encryption type. Now uses migrate_private_key to
	convert privkey->keypair. Reading privkey packets from stdin only works
	if the get_passphrase hook is defined for that key.
	Fix packet_roundabout_test; the send+receive part was using an empty
	stream, rather than the packet sequence generated in the first part.
	* packet.hh, commands.cc, key_store.cc: read_packets now takes an
	app_state argument.
	* tests/t_dropkey_2.at: use genkey instead of reading packets
	* tests/t_read_privkey.at: check that reading a privkey packet works
	* testsuite.at: add read_privkey test

2005-12-06  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* ui.cc (write_ticks): Move CR out of tickline2; output it where
	required instead.  Fixes brokeness of 'count' ticker on Win32 (and
	perhaps elsewhere) that was causing each line redraw to be written
	on a new line.
	* contrib/usher.cc (fork_server): Avoid getting stuck in an
	infinte loop attempting to read() from a stream that has
	reached EOF before we've read anything from it.  This can occur if
	the fork()+exec() of an usher managed monotone server fails.
	* ui.cc (write_ticks): Don't call display_width() repeatedly for
	the same string--get the result once and reuse it where necessary.
	* netxx/sockopt.cxx, netxx/sockopt.h (set_ipv6_listen_for_v6_only):
	New member function to set the IPV6_V6ONLY flag on a socket.
	* netxx/serverbase.cxx (bind_to): Call set_ipv6_listen_for_v6_only
	on IPv6 sockets.
	* app_state.cc (allow_working_copy): Use keydir path from
	MT/options if set.

2005-12-05  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_database_sig_cleanup.at: Mark this as NOT_ON_WIN32; as
	per the MSDN link I've added to the test, we can't handle
	SIGINT/SIGTERM gracefully on Windows.

2005-12-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc (file_path): MM() the path we're validating.

2005-12-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* schema_migration.cc: Modernize error checking a bit.  (Use E()
	and I() instead of throwing runtime_errors.)

2005-12-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* sanity.cc (dump_buffer): If we dumped debug info, write out a
	note asking that it be included in bug reports.

2005-12-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* schema_migration.cc (logged_sqlite3_exec): New function.
	Use everywhere in this file.  Enables logging of migration
	commands for debugging purposes.

2005-12-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_mixed_case_pwd.at, testsuite.at: New test.

2005-12-02  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Make Win32 build link against shfolder.lib to get
	SHGetFolderPathA on older Windows platforms (we had previously
	been relying on it to be available in shell32.lib) .
	* packet.cc (feed_packet_consumer::feed_packet_consumer,
	extract_packets): Move duplicated sets of regexs for key IDs,
	certs, etc. into constants.cc.
	* constants.{cc,hh}: Add regex strings extracted from packet.cc.  Also
	fix the key ID regex to accept a few characters we allowed in
	legal_key_name_bytes already.
	* tests/t_genkey.at: Test good and bad keys with all characters we
	allow in the user portion of a key id.

2005-12-01  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* database.cc: Revert last change; db version and db migrate need
	to be able to open databases with old schema versions.  Calling
	sql() directly broke this.  Moved a db existence check scattered
	through the code into db_check_exists(), and added calls to this
	into ::version and ::migrate.
	* database.cc (database::version, database::migrate): Improve
	error handling where user has supplied the path to a non-existant
	database file.  Submitted by Neil Conway.
	* win32/fs.cc (rename_clobberingly_impl): Improve error handling
	around LoadLibrary call.
	* lua/{lvm.c,lgc.c,lapi.c}: Lua post-5.0.2 bugfixes from
	http://www.lua.org/bugs.html.  Submitted by Alex Queiroz.

2005-11-29  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am: add PCH_FLAGS only when compiling monotone and
	unit_tests objects, not for libs.
	* pch.hh: define __STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS as required for UINT32_C.

2005-11-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* txt2c.cc (main): Work correctly even on empty files.

2005-11-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* schema_migration.cc: Provide more feedback while 'db migrate' is
	running.

2005-11-28  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* HACKING: Make a note of the fact that we kill 'monotone serve'
	processes with a SIGSEGV.
	* tests/README: Minor cleanup, mention SIGSEGV thing here too.

2005-11-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* std_hooks.lua: Make regexp matching error slightly more
	user-friendly.

2005-11-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (diff): Remove OPT_BRANCH from diff's options.

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac: Do not use test's == operator because it is not
	compatible with many implementations; use = instead.

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac, ui.cc: Windows does have sync_with_iostream; the
	problem is that it does not behave correctly on some MinGW versions.
	Properly detect this condition.  Thanks to Matthew Gregan for the
	explanation.

2005-11-27  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* netxx/address.cxx (parse_uri): Reset URI parser state after
	checking for IPv6 address.

2005-11-27  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_netsync_largish_file.at: Move LARGISH_FILE_CREATE
	definition from here...
	* testsuite.at: ...to here.
	* tests/t_dump_load.at: Use LARGISH_FILE_CREATE to create a 1MB
	file so that the db dump output is larger than a few kB.  This is
	needed to catch the iostreams-returning-EOF-early bogosity under
	MinGW when sync_with_stdio(false) has been called on the iostream.

2005-11-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.cc: Include "i18n.h" instead of "libintl.h" directly,
	to theoretically play better with autoconf stuff.

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* tests/t_automate_stdio.at: Don't expect perl to be in /usr/bin;
	this assumption doesn't hold breaks on several systems (such as
	NetBSD).

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* tests/t_checkout_options.at: Use the [] operator instead of {} in
	a shell pattern so that it works with interpreters other than bash
	(e.g., NetBSD's sh).

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* testsuite.at, tests/t_empty_env.at, tests/t_i18n_file.at,
	tests/t_netsync_sigpipe.at, tests/t_update_1.at, tests/t_update_2.at:
	Do not use test's == operator because it is not portable; use =
	instead.

2005-11-27  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, pch.hh: add --enable-pch configure
	flag to enable precompiled boost headers. Based on LyX automake/autoconf
	rules, Zbynek Winkler suggested that just boost headers would be
	beneficial.

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* app_state.cc: No need to include headers for chdir() any more.
	This function was replaced by change_current_working_dir.
	* monotone.cc: Unconditionally include libintl.h as this file uses
	gettext functions.
	* configure.ac, rcs_import.cc: Check for strptime(3) and use the
	check results instead of assuming that only Windows lacks this
	function.
	* configure.ac, ui.cc: Check whether C++ streams support the
	sync_with_stdio method and use the check results instead of assuming
	that only Windows lacks this function.

	Addresses part of bug #12086.

2005-11-27  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* app_state.cc: Correctly detect when MT/options does not have a
	database property instead of printing the cryptic message "misuse:
	invalid path ''".

2005-11-27  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* configure.ac: expose --enable-ipv6 in config.h
	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): parse IPv6 addresses correctly 
	in --bind arguments
	* netsync.cc (call_server,serve_connections): if USE_IPV6 defined, 
	create netxx Address instances with ipv6 enabled.
	* netxx/address.cxx (parse_uri): parse IPv6 addresses as hostnames
	* closes bug #14446

2005-11-27  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* automate.cc (automate_stdio_read): remove check for EINTR
	that was breaking win32 build.

2005-11-27  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* automate.cc (automate_certs,automate_keys): use non-exclusive 
	transaction guard
	* commands.cc (ls_certs,ls_keys,cat): use non-exclusive 
	transaction guard
	* database.cc (begin_transaction): used BEGIN DEFERRED (only attempt 
	exclusive lock once a write is attempted on DB) when not exclusive
	(transaction_guard::transaction_guard): new argument exclusive indicating 
	whether an immediate exclusive lock is requested, defaults to true
	* database.hh: update prototype for transaction_guard

2005-11-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Fill in date for 0.24 release.

2005-11-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* UPGRADE: Add note about serve changing syntax.

2005-11-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* UPGRADE: Update for 0.24.
	* configure.ac, win32/monotone.iss, monotone.spec:
	* debian/changelog: Bump version number.

2005-11-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* ChangeLog: fixup after merge.

2005-11-27  Daniel Carosone  <dan@geek.com.au>

	* monotone.texi, std_hooks.lua: sync hook definitions with
	std_hooks.lua, and group the descriptions into @subsections,
	reordering a few items accordingly.

2005-11-26  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am: Remove botan/{omac,fips_rng}.h.

2005-11-26  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog: Update my email address; I don't read the
	other one any more and the new one represents better my limited
	involvement in Monotone.

2005-11-26  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac, Makefile.am, po/Makevars: Avoid using xgettext's
	--flag option on versions that do not support it.

2005-11-26  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* automate.cc (automate_stdio) add wrapper function to read()
	so that loops will not wind backwards possibly overrunning buffers
	if an error occurs. Hopefully fixes some of the strange edge cases
	seen using automate. (Closes #15062 in bug tracker)

2005-11-26  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* botan/mem_pool.cpp (Pooling_Allocator::allocate): Botan's
	Pooling_Allocator assumes that Buffers stored in free_list are
	sorted, and uses std::inplace_merge() in deallocate() to ensure
	the recently freed Buffer is positioned in free_list
	appropriately.  This same check was not being performed when a
	Buffer was added to free_list in allocate() (it's not safe to
	assume that the address of a newly allocated Buffer will always be
	greated than existing Buffers).

2005-11-25  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (get_version): Another important fix: make sure to
	cancel overlapping paths, to avoid exponential memory requirement
	in deep, heavily-forked-and-merged storage paths.

2005-11-25  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (get_version): Another important fix: make sure to
	cancel overlapping paths, to avoid exponential memory requirement
	in deep, heavily-forked-and-merged storage paths.

2005-11-25  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (get_version): Crucial fix! Rewrite the
	delta-reconstruction algorithm to work with a DAG storage topology,
	rather than assuming an inverted tree. Counterpart to the
	delta-storage optimization made by Timothy Brownawell on
	2005-11-05.

2005-11-23  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/*: import of Botan 1.4.9

2005-11-23  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* automate.cc (automate_stdio): Fix partial reads cloberring 
	start of buffer.

2005-11-22  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* database.cc (database::dump): Don't include SQLite internal
	tables in the dump.
	* tests/t_dump_load.at (database dump/load): Run a db analyze
	before dumping the db--catches cases where we dump internal db
	tables that we can't reload.

2005-11-21  Henry Nestler  <Henry@BigFoot.de>

	* contrib/mtbrowse.sh: Version 0.1.13
	Handle authors without '@'.  Minor box sizing.
	Get Version of monotone before starts anything.
	DEPTH_LAST detects for version >0.19, no save to config.
	'cat revision' replaced with 'automate get_revision'.
	ANCESTORS "M" changed to "A". Default "L" (monotone log --brief).
	Warn user about misconfigurations. Temp files without tailing dot.
	New option: Sort by Date/Time, up or down.
	Fix: Parents of merge, if certs list from cache (ncolor).

2005-11-21  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* NEWS: Minor spelling tweaks.
	* platform.hh: Add get_default_confdir().
	* app_state.cc (app_state::app_state): Call get_default_confdir()
	to initialize confdir.
	* unix/fs.cc (get_default_confdir): Use the home directory as the
	base of the default configuration dir.
	* win32/fs.cc (get_default_confdir): Use either %APPDATA% or the
	result of querying SHGetFolderPath() for CISDL_APPDATA as the base
	of the default configuration dir.
	(get_homedir): More consistent method for deciding what the user's
	home directory is.  Behaviour based on the documentation for Qt's
	QDir::home().

	* std_hooks.lua (edit_comment): Insert a blank line if there is no
	user log message, so the user doesn't have to.

	* tests/t_automate_keys.at: Don't rely on extended sed either!

2005-10-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.{hh,cc}: Clean-up previous change -- switch to using a
	cleanup_ptr to hold sqlite3_stmt handles, for proper exception
	safety.

2005-10-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* database.cc (fetch): Do not insert prepared statements into the
	statement table until they are successfully created, to avoid
	segfaults on database teardown.

2005-10-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_automate_keys.at: Use sed rather than relying on an
	extended grep being available.

2005-10-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* contrib/ciabot_monotone.py (send_change_for): Handle branch-less
	revisions.

2005-10-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.cc: Make initial_rel_path an fs::path.  Adjust code
	correspondingly.  Add tests that calling monotone from inside MT
	should work.
	* tests/t_add_inside_MT.at, testsuite.at: New test.

2005-10-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* win32/fs.cc: Don't consider USERPROFILE as a possible home
	directory; APPDATA is more appropriate.  Add a second method to
	get the APPDATA path.  Always use HOME if it's set (not just under
	Cygwin/MinGW).
	* tests/t_netsync_absorbs.at: Add missing CANONICALISE().

2005-10-07  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

2005-10-07  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* automate.cc: add "automate keys". like "ls keys", except it
	uses basic_io (since "ls keys" is now slightly irregular and not
	very well suited to machine interpretation).
	* monotone.texi: document it
	* tests/t_automate_keys.at: test for it
	* testsuite.at: add test
	* basic_io.{cc,hh} (stanza): add push_str_multi, for entries
	that can take a variable number of string arguments.

	misc minor whitespace cleanup

2005-10-06  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

		* command reference :: key and cert
		* command reference :: packet I/O

2005-10-06  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc (chkeypass): doesn't use the db, so we don't need a guard
	* commands.cc (dropkey): don't insist on having a db
	* tests/t_genkey_without_db.at: rename (s/genkey/key_management) and
	add checks for chkeypass and dropkey without a db

2005-10-06  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* database.{cc,hh}: new function, database::database_specified()
	return whether we were given a database (doesn't care about validity,
	only that we were told to use one)
	* commands.cc (genkey): don't insist on having a db, but still
	check it for duplicates if we're given one.
	* tests/t_genkey_without_db.at: make sure it works
	* testsuite.at: add test

2005-09-28  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* keys.cc (get_private_key): don't use lua hook passwords for
	chkeypass.

2005-09-28  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* keys.cc (get_private_keys): don't use lua hook passwords for
	chkeypass.

2005-09-28  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* key_store.cc: fix delete_key
	* tests/t_database_check_normalized: needs 'db migrate'
	* tests/t_lua_privkey.at: update for new key location
	* tests/t_netsync_absorbs.at: use genkey instead of packets
	* tests/t_netsync_checks_server_key.at: same
	* tests/t_netsync_pubket.at: update key packet to new format

2005-09-27  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	Replace extract_keys command with a database migrator.
	* database.{cc,hh}: Remove last traces of private keys in db.
	* schema.sql: Remove private_keys table
	* commands.cc (dropkey): private keys can no longer be in the db.
	* schema_migration.cc: new migrator
	* commands.cc: remove extract_keys
	* tests/t_migrate_schema.at: update
	* keys.hh, cert.cc, key_store.cc: keys_match doesn't work well on
	privkeys. Don't use it.
	* key_store.cc: Allow duplicate insertions, if they match.

2005-09-27  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* schema_migration.hh: migrate_depot_schema() doesn't really exist
	* database.cc, schema_migration.{cc,hh}: migrate_monotone_schema
	now takes an app_state * , so data can be moved to/from the database.

2005-09-27  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/pkcs8.cc, keys.cc: fix monotone-specific pkcs8 key
	parsing.
	* commands.cc: ls keys shows keystore-only pubkeys as well
	* packet.cc: fix unit tests
	* testsuite.at: use keypair packet rather than privkey/pubkey 
	packets.

2005-09-26  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc, keys.cc, others: use standard
	"PBE-PKCS5v20(SHA-1,TripleDES/CBC)" encoding rather than
	raw arc4. extract_keys will re-encode keys, still
	need to work on packet.cc encoding.
	* botan/{des*,pkcs5*,algolist.cpp}: required files
	from Botan 1.4.6

2005-09-25  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	Move private keys outside the database.
	They're now stored as keypairs in ~/.monotone/keys
	Details:
	* keystore.{cc,hh}: handle storage of keypairs
	* tests*: Specify keystore location when running the testsuite.
		This prevents it from polluting the user's keystore.
	* database{cc,hh}: remove ability to put privkeys. They can still
		be listed, retrieved, and deleted, to support
	* commands.cc: New command, extract_keys. Copies private keys from
		the database to the keystore.
	* vocab.hh: add keypair type, like pair<pubkey, privkey>, except that
		the members are named pub and priv.
	* packet.cc: Clean up read_packets.
	* packet.{cc,hh}: privkey packets no longer exists, handle keypair
		packets instead.
	* file_io.{cc,hh}: add read_directory because tree_walker needs to
		be in the wc. add a write_data that works outside the wc.
	* Makefile.am: add keystore.{cc,hh}
	* others: update to work with new key storage

2005-10-06  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* std_hooks.lua (merge3_emacs_cmd): Minor cleanup.
	* std_hooks.lua: Pass '--eval' rather than '-eval' to Emacs; the
	CVS emacsclient does not consider '-eval' as valid.
	* platform.hh, unix/fs.cc, win32/fs.cc (rename_clobberingly): New
	function for best-effort atomic renames.  This will probably never
	be atomic on Win32.
	* file_io.cc (write_data_impl): Append process ID to temporary
	file name so that multiple monotone processes operating on the
	same working copy are less likely to clobber each other.  Use
	rename_clobberingly().
	* ui.cc (user_interface): Allow std::cout to raise
	ios_base::failure exceptions if stream goes bad (e.g. stream
	receives EPIPE).
	* monotone.cc (cpp_main): Catch ios_base::failure exceptions and
	exit cleanly.
	* main.cc (main_with_signal_handlers): Install handler to ignore
	SIGPIPE.
	* Makefile.am: Remove platform_netsync.cc references.
	* {unix,win32}/platform_netsync.cc: Remove files.
	* platform.hh, netsync.cc (run_netsync_protocol):
	Remove {start,end}_platform_netsync() calls.

2005-10-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	numbers in 'automate inventory' output format.

2005-10-04  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/, Makefile.am: update to Botan 1.4.7

2005-10-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi (Automation): Clean up formatting and description
	of 'automate inventory' sample output.

2005-10-02  Marcel van der Boom  <marcel@hsdev.com>

	earlier, so we can fail earlier.

2005-09-30  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (AM_CFLAGS, AM_CXXFLAGS): Add
	-DBOOST_SP_DISABLE_THREADS (disables thread-safe shared_ptr

	* debian/README.Debian, debian/TODO.Debian: Add debian files
	left out of repository.

2005-09-30  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* NEWS: Set date for 0.23.

2005-09-30  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

2005-09-30  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* paths.cc: remove unit tests for 
	file_path_internal_from_user

2005-09-30  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* configure.ac: only add gnu specific CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS for
	gnu compilers

2005-09-30  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_log_outside_working_dir.at: Fix summary line.

	  of a working dir (with a file specified)
	* tests/t_log_outside_working_dir.at: check log works outside 
	  of a working dir (with a file specified)
	* tests/t_diff_changeset_bug.at: mysterious changeset bug

2005-09-29  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* AUTHORS: Add Grahame and Marcel.
	* NEWS: Write 0.23 entry.
	* monotone.texi (Reserved Files): Mention in .mt-ignore docs that
	the patterns are regexes.
	
2005-09-30  Grahame Bowland  <grahame@angrygoats.net>

	* paths.cc (file_path::file_path): Allow external paths outside of
	a working directory, so long as we don't enter a working directory 
	later.
	(access_tracker) add new very_uninitialized state which 
	prevents subsequent initialization
	(test_access_tracker) check the very_uninitialized state works
	* paths.hh: correct mention of monotone cat file to new syntax

2005-09-29  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* paths.cc: Restore two unit tests on Win32.

2005-09-29  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* testsuite.at: Removed a spurious G...

2005-09-29  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* paths.cc, win32/fs.cc: Fixes to allow unit tests to pass on Win32.

2005-09-29  Marcel van der Boom  <marcel@hsdev.com>

	* netsync.cc (rebuild_merkle_trees): only get matched branch
	certs, not all of them

2005-09-28  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_rename_diff_names.at, testsuite.at: New test.

2005-09-27  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.texi (Tutorial): It seems like texi2pdf gets quite
	confused when a @chapter has a @subsection with a @section in
	between.  The resulting PDF had a Tutorial that was a indexed as a
	subsection under Concepts/Branches instead of being indexed as the
	chapter it is, and most confusingly, it's last subsection
	(Branching and Merging) ended up as a a separate chapter of it's
	own...

2005-09-27  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* netsync.cc (ancestry_fetcher): new approach to requesting file
	and manifest deltas and full data. Tries to be more efficient
	for the vcache of recontstructed data, and conceptually simpler

	* tests/t_netsync_unrelated.at: passes, remove XFAIL

2005-09-26  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* database.cc: Merged 3 strings.

2005-09-26  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* commands.cc: add 'help' command
	* monotone.cc: add -h alias for --help
	
2005-09-25  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* netsync.cc: use lexical_cast on port numbers to avoid
	strange-looking "port 5,253"

2005-09-25  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* sqlite/*: Update in-tree SQLite from 3.2.6 to 3.2.7.

2005-09-25  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* netsync.cc: 3 more i18n strings.

2005-09-25  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* cert.cc (cert_signable_text): F() vs. boost::format.
	* lua.cc (monotone_guess_binary_file_contents_for_lua),
	(monotone_include_for_lua), (monotone_includedir_for_lua):
	* rcs_import.cc (import_cvs_repo): Merged some strings.
	
2005-09-25  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* lua.cc (monotone_guess_binary_file_contents_for_lua):
	Fixed signednes warning and istream usage.

	I don't understand how xxdiff works :/ Please help.

2005-09-24  Satoru SATOH <ss@gnome.gr.jp>

	* po/ja.po: Updated Japanese translation.

2005-09-23  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

        * std_hooks.lua: More i18n strings.

        I don't know how to handle lua
        "multiline" ..
        "strings" because gettext doesn't join them.

2005-09-22  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

        * sanity.{cc,hh}: Uninlined F() and FP().
        This happily saves ~100KB of .text on my ppc.

2005-09-22  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* netsync.cc: Reverted changes
	from f0a632bf14468b6e03a488d6f1a64ef18b61d04c
	to   4f7f638954c79c54460d04c3be111acad8b26dd3

	with --exclude
	* tests/t_restriction_with_exclude_iprint.at: remove XFAIL

2005-09-20  Patrick Mauritz <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* configure.ac: solaris needs librt for fdatasync
	* sqlite/parse.c: #line and #include interactions aren't defined

2005-09-20  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* database.cc (space_usage): workaround the issue that in sqlite
	3.2.6, SUM({empty set}) returns NULL. (this is part of the sql spec,
	see http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/tktview?tn=1413 and the comment for
	SUM() in sqlite docs).

2005-09-20  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* ui.cc, ui.hh, sanity.hh: replace ui.user_locale with
	get_user_locale(), so that we can guarantee that it will be
	initialised when the global_sanity object (and probably other things)
	are instantiated.

2005-09-20  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_restriction_with_exclude_iprint.at: New test, variant of
	t_restriction_exclude.at, but with inodeprints enabled.  Mark as
	XFAILed.
	* testsuite.at: Add new test.
	* sqlite/*: Update in-tree SQLite from 3.2.2 to 3.2.6.
	* Makefile.am: Add sqlite/{analyze,vbdefifo,complete}.c to
	SQLITE_SOURCES
	* schema_migration.cc (calculate_schema_id): Explicitly exclude
	sqlite_stat1 table from schema ID calculation.  This is a new
	magic table created by the 'analyze' command in SQLite >= 3.2.3.

2005-09-18  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* po/ja.po: New translation from Satoru SATOH <ss@gnome.gr.jp>.
	* AUTHORS: Add Satoru SATOH.
	
2005-09-18  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* testsuite.at: Tweak default 'eveything' netsync glob to
	something that works around the MinGW/Win32 globbing issues for
	now.
	* tests/t_log_brief.at: Canonicalise output on Win32.

2005-09-17  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* contrib/usher.cc: Remove stray "new int[2];' statements from
	debugging. Remove connections from list when finished.

2005-09-16  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): add contrib/monotone-cvs-ignore.lua,
	contrib/ciabot_monotone_hookversion.py, and contrib/usher.cc .
	also remove duplicate of contrib/monoprof.sh

2005-09-16  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* netsync.cc: finish renaming things, so it compiles again...

2005-09-16  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* contrib/usher.cc: A simple usher/proxy server. It asks connecting
	clients for their include pattern, and then forwards the connection
	to an appropriate (as given in a config file) monotone server. Note
	that all servers operating behind one usher need to have the same
	server key.

2005-09-16  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* netcmd.{cc,hh}, netsync.cc: new netcmd types: usher_cmd and
	usher_reply_cmd. They are not included in the HMAC, and do not
	occur during normal communication. Purpose: running multiple servers
	from the same port. This allows a special server to ask for the
	client's include pattern, and then forward the connection to a real
	monotone server.

2005-09-16  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/pkcs8.cpp: re-add the monotone-specific code for guessing if
	a key is DER encoded or not.

2005-09-16  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/*: update to Botan 1.4.6
	* Makefile.am: ditto

2005-09-15  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* commands.cc: commit and revert now take OPT_EXCLUDE
	* monotone.cc: update description of --exclude
	* tests/t_restriction_with_exclude.at: new test
	* testsuite.at: add it

2005-09-14  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* contrib/ciabot_monotone_hookversion.py: CIA bot client script
	meant to be called from the note_netsync_revision_received hook.
	* lua.{cc,hh}: hook_note_commit and hook_note_netsync_revision_received
	now take the text of the revision as an argument.
	* netsync.cc, commands.cc: Give hooks new argument.
	* monotone.texi: Update documentation for those hooks.

2005-09-11  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* database.cc
	* database_check.cc
	* netsync.cc
	* po/POTFILES.in
	* po/POTFILES.skip
	* rcs_import.cc: More i18n strings.

2005-09-07  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>
	
	* tests/t_rename_dir_cross_level.at: When invoking mv to rename
	a directory, do not include a trailing slash on the target -- that
	is not portable.                                                  

	* Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Ensure that PATH starts with
	the current directory, so we test the just-built monotone binary,
	not some older version.                                          

2005-09-07  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* std_hooks.lua: Don't spawn emacs with '-no-init-file'.

2005-09-09  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* paths.cc (save_initial_path): Default Boost's fs::path to
	fs::native grammar.
	* tests/t_unreadable_{db,MT}.at: Disable on Win32 for now.
	* paths.cc: Consistency--use WIN32 rather than _WIN32.
	* file_io.cc (walk_tree): Correct test for file existence.

2005-09-08  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Add '-f' argument to 'mv'; avoids build waiting on
	 user confirmation in some cases.

2005-09-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.texi (Certificates): Remove mention of fcerts and
	mcerts.

2005-09-07  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	(delete_dir_recursive): Implement.

2005-08-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Audit uses of 'file_exists', because its semantics have changed;
	it now checks to see if a path exists and is a regular file,
	rather than that it simply exists.  A fair amount of code already
	thought it meant that... other places now use 'path_exists'.
	
2005-08-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	directories are probably broken).

2005-08-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* app_state.cc (allow_working_copy): 
	* change_set.cc (print_insane_change_set): Two more small compile

2005-08-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* paths.hh (any_path::as_internal): On second thought, return a
	std::string, not a utf8 -- utf8 would be better, but should wait
	for some more general charset handling cleanup.
	* Adjust other files accordingly.
	
2005-08-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* More compile fixes.  All remaing compile errors are real
	problems, yay.

	are confusing.

2005-08-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Back out most changes since
	b580c6ac5bf8eea1f442b8bddc60283b047ade1e.  Handling charsets
	properly by working in utf8 and then converting sucks.  Problems
	include
	  - gettext hates you (wants to return stuff in local charset)
	  - strerror hates you (same reason, but you can't turn it off)
	  - can't report charset conversion errors
	We thus return to our "sorta-correct, by accident" status quo.
	Only change left in is signedness fix in
	5548868ab56d939c1fd8713aa2ac8caacd1184a1.

2005-08-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	conversion and make --help output actually correct.

2005-08-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* transforms.cc (outprep): Don't sanitize all output; removes too
	many valid characters (\r, \t, etc.).
	* ui.cc: Call outprep on ticker output.
	(inform): Do still sanitize ui.inform() output.

2005-08-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* transforms.cc (outprep): New function.
	* ui.cc (inform): Use it.

2005-08-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* idna/nfkc.c (g_utf8_strlen): Expose.
	* transforms.{cc,hh} (length): New function.
	* ui.cc (write_ticks): Use length() instead of .size() to
	calculate string widths; should support multibyte characters
	better.  (Still some problems relating to truncating strings to
	avoid overflow -- calculate truncation by length, but perform
	truncation by bytes...)

2005-08-24  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2005-08-24  Benoît Dejean  <benoit@placenet.org>

2005-08-23  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc: Make all CMD() calls use N_() instead of _().

	* keys.cc (get_passphrase): Put back trailing ": " removed in

2005-08-17  Timothy Brownawell  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>

	* sanity.cc (gasp()): When catching an error from dumping a MM'd
	variable, do not discard output generated prior to the error. This
	way, at least the header line (function name, file, line no.) is
	printed.
	* change_set.cc: write_insane_change_set: new function to write a
	change set without sanity checking it, now used by dump().

2005-08-17  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* unix/process.cc: missing include
	* m4/fexceptions.m4, configure.ac, Makefile.am: remove hardcoded

	out.

2005-08-17  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* work.cc (build_additions): Tweak wording.

2005-08-17  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	be necessary to change permission bits.

2005-08-17  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* unix/process.cc (is_executable, make_executable): When reporting
	an error in a syscall, include the actual error message.

	it, to give better logging.
	
2005-08-17  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* Makefile.am (lib3rdparty_a_CFLAGS): Build 3rd party C code with

	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2005-08-15  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (fcommit): Remove.  This command has never been
	documented, tested, or maintained; it also doesn't avoid the use
	of temporary files (which was supposed to be its purpose).  Has it
	ever actually been used...?
	
2005-08-15  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* lua.cc (hook_init_attributes): Do more logging; use begin()
	instead of starting iteration by hand.

2005-08-15  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* testsuite.at, tests/*.at: make testsuite less demanding:
	- QGREP() and QEGREP() provide a portable [e]grep -q
	- export FOO=bar -> FOO=bar; export FOO
	- tail -n $x -> TAIL($x) with appropriate macro

2005-08-15  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* m4/typeof.m4: new test, looks if compiler knows the typeof()
	extension

	__PRETTY_FUNCTION__ and similar pseudo-macros

2005-08-15  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* configure.ac (BOOST_FIX_VERSION): only apply that fix on gcc.

2005-08-14  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* configure.ac (BOOST_VERSION_CHECK, BOOST_FIX_VERSION): Fix for
	cross-compilation.  (Thanks to John Bowler <jbowler@acm.org>.)

2005-08-14  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* Makefile.am: Minor cleanups.

2005-08-13  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	std:: prefix

2005-08-13  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* schema_migration.cc (lowercase): it's only used for processing sha1
	values whos size we know: make array size constant
	* transforms.cc (encode_hexenc, decode_hexenc): they have to work with
	all kinds of string sizes, so at least make them nicer by using
	boost::scoped_array

2005-08-13  Patrick Mauritz  <oxygene@studentenbude.ath.cx>

	* revision.cc: make copy constructor of revision_set behave like
	normal constructor in case it's copying a freshly created object

2005-08-13  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* testsuite.at: Use SEGV to kill netsync servers, in hopes it will
	give better coverage information.

2005-08-13  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac: Remove an obsolete check to see if SQLite was
	bundled or not, because the bundled version has been used
	exclusively for quite some time.

2005-08-13  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* database_check.cc: Remove trailing newline from error messages
	when embedding them inside other strings, so that the trailing
	closing parenthesis is printed correctly.

2005-08-13  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* configure.ac: Add '-mt' as another possible suffix to detect the
	Boost libraries.  It's very common when these libraries are built
	with the "native naming layout".

2005-08-13  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* monotone.1, monotone.texi: Don't mention agraph.
	* tests/t_netsync_repeated.at: Don't use agraph.

	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2005-08-12  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (commit): When user uses --message or
	--message-file, don't require non-empty logs, and don't write out
	message to MT/log.  (This makes re-running a 'commit -m foo'
	command line until it works possible; otherwise the second try
	will get a 'MT/log non-empty and -m supplied' error.)

2005-08-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc: Add a list of ideas for improvement that will break
	network compatibility and thus perhaps should go together.

2005-08-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* tests/t_commit_message_file.at: Un-double file contents.

2005-08-11  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* config.rpath, mkinstalldirs, po/Makefile.in.in,
	  various files in m4, ABOUT-NLS:
	  remove as they're autogenerated
	* hash_map.hh, m4/gnucxxhashmap.m4, m4/stlporthashmap.m4:
	  new files, abstraction over hash_map differences in STL impls.
	* m4/externtemplate.m4: new file, check if compiler is happy
	  with "extern template"
	* configure.ac: hook up the new autoconf tests
	* Makefile.am: remove -Wall
	* botan/gzip.cpp, botan/mutex.cpp: add includes
	* constants.*: move values to .hh if used for array sizes
	* interner.hh, xdelta.cc: use hash_map.hh
	* merkle_tree.cc, unix/inodeprint.cc: make array size truly
	  constant 
	* sanity.hh: work-around for missing typeof() and
	  __PRETTY_FUNCTIONS on non-gcc compilers
	* schema_migration.cc, transforms.cc: moved dynamically
	  initialized array to heap
	* transforms.hh, vocab.hh: use externtemplate autoconf test

2005-08-10  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* monotone.spec: include zlib-devel and texinfo as build
	requirements, zlib as a runtime requirement.

2005-08-09  Eric Anderson  <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>

	* tests/perf-test.sh: A repeatable performance test harness
	* tests/parse-accounting.pl: A script that parses the accounting
	output into a nice tabular format

2005-08-09  Eric Anderson  <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>
 
	* Changes to significantly improve network pull performance
	* string_queue.hh: created to store pending data and allow for
	efficient removal from the front.  The string queue automatically
	reduces its buffer size if it is very empty.  	
	* hmac.{cc,hh}: Add in a version of chained_hmac::process that can
	operate on a string_queue for use during read.
	* netcmd.{cc,hh}: update netcmd::read to use a string_queue rather
	than a string, update all the regression tests also.  This required
	the somewhat ugly creation of a read_string function because the
	netcmd read and write functions are no longer using the same type.
	* netio.hh: introduce functions for operating on a string_queue. They
	are identical to the equivalent string functions except for the type
	of the argument.
	* netsync.cc: Use a string_queue rather than a string for storing the 
	input and output buffers.

	* string_queue.cc: unit tests (Matt Johnston)

2005-08-09  Richard Li  <richardl@redhat.com>

	* std_hooks.lua (merge2, merge3): explain a little better why
	monotone can't find a merge command.

2005-08-09  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (update): Fix helpful error message to suggest
	_current_ commandline syntax.

2005-08-09  Olivier Andrieu  <oliv__a@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-08-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc (rebuild_merkle_trees, insert_with_parents): Make a
	ticker for added revisions, since traversing the tree to pull in
	ancestors causes a noticeable pause before the cert/key tickers
	start up.
	(insert_with_parents): Also simplify logic.

2005-08-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* commands.cc (pull): Clarify what the "doing anonymous pull"

2005-08-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* netsync.cc (rebuild_merkle_trees): Tweak message ("rebuilding

	error message, explain how to recover.

2005-08-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@pobox.com>

	* testsuite.at (NETSYNC_ADDRESS): New macro.

	depend on monotone.info, since they are built from the .texi
	files.  Also, make the monotone.html and html targets depend
	on version.texi and std_hooks.lua as well.

	get_preferred_merge3_command): EDITOR may be undefined.  In that

	load Lua code into the VM.  Allows us to report syntax errors when
	loading rc files.
	* testsuite.at: test_hooks.lua was calling nonexistent (obsolete)

	reporting from Lua caught this and cause testsuite failures.

	Win32/MingW only.

	* monotone.cc, options.hh: Move the option numbers to options.hh,
	so they can be easily retrieved by other modules.
	* monotone.cc: split the options table in global options and
	command specific options.  The former are always understood, while
	the latter are only understood by the commands that declare it
	(see below).
	(my_poptStuffArgFile): There's no need to keep a copy of the
	stuffed argv.  This was really never a problem.
	(coption_string): New function to find the option string from an
	option number.
	(cpp_main): Keep track of which command-specific options were
	given, and check that the given command really uses them.  Make
	sure that when the help is written, only the appropriate command-
	specific options are shown.  We do this by hacking the command-
	specific options table.
	Throw away sub_argvs, as it's not needed any more (and realy never
	was).

	(commands_ops): New structure to hold the option
	numbers used by a command.
	(commands): Use it.
	(command_options): Function to get the set of command-specific
	options for a specific command.

	specific options this command takes.  Note that for commands that
	do not take command-specific options, this new parameter must
	still be given, just left empty.
	Update all commands with this new parameter.
	* commands.hh: Declare command_options.

	* tests/t_automate_heads.at: 'automate heads' never used the value
	of --branch.
	* tests/t_sticky_branch.at: and neither did 'log'...

2005-04-23  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* tests/t_diff_currev.at: Use CHECK_SAME_STDOUT.

2005-04-23  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

2005-04-22  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* manifest.{cc,hh} (build_restricted_manifest_map): keep and
	return a set of missing files rather than failing on first missing
	file

	* vocab.cc (verify(file_path), verify(local_path)): Normalize
	paths on the way in.
	* tests/t_normalized_filenames.at: Fix to match behavior
	eventually declared "correct".

2005-04-22  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* vocab.{cc,hh}: Make verify functions public, make ATOMIC(foo)'s
	verify function a friend of foo, add ATOMIC_NOVERIFY macro, add
	long comment explaining all this.
	* vocab_terms.hh: Add _NOVERIFY to some types.

2005-04-22  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* file_io.{cc,hh} (localized): Take file_path/local_path instead
	of string; expose in public interface.  Adjust rest of file to
	match.
	(walk_tree): Don't convert the (OS-supplied) current directory
	from UTF-8 to current locale.
	
	* transforms.{cc,hh} (charset_convert): Be more informative on
	error.
	(calculate_ident): Localize the filename, even on the fast-path.
	Also assert file exists and is not a directory, since Crypto++
	will happily hash directories.  (They are like empty files,
	apparently.)
	
	* manifest.cc (build_restricted_manifest_map): Use file_exists
	instead of fs::exists, to handle localized paths.
	* {win32,unix}/inodeprint.cc (inodeprint_file): Use localized
	filenames to stat.

	* tests/t_i18n_file.at: Rewrite to work right.

	* tests/t_normalized_filenames.at: New test.

	file_path either.
	(test_file_path_normalization): New unit-test.

2005-04-22  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* monotone.texi: Changed all quoting of example command lines to
	use " instead of ', since this works everywhere, but ' doesn't
	work on Win32

2005-04-21  Jeremy Cowgar  <jeremy@cowgar.com>

	* tests/t_multiple_heads_msg.at: Now checks to ensure 'multiple head'
	  message does not occur on first commit (which creates a new head
	  but not multiple heads).
	* commands.cc (CMD(commit)): renamed head_size to better described
	  old_head_size, now checks that old_head_size is larger than 0 as
	  well otherwise, on commit of a brand new project, a new head was
	  detected and a divergence message was displayed.

2005-04-21  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* commands.cc (ALIAS): refactor so you don't have to repeat all
	the strings given to the original command.
	(ALIAS(ci)): added as a short form for CMD(commit).

	using ps2eps.

	* change_set.cc (apply_path_rearrangement_can_fastpath) 
	(apply_path_rearrangement_fastpath) 
	(apply_path_rearrangement_slowpath, apply_path_rearrangement):
	Refactor into pieces, so all versions of apply_path_rearrangement
	can take a fast-path when possible.

2005-04-21  Jeremy Cowgar  <jeremy@cowgar.com>

	* commands.cc: Renamed maybe_show_multiple_heads to
	  notify_if_multiple_heads, renamed headSize to head_size for
	  coding standards/consistency.
	* tests/t_multiple_heads_msg.at: Added to monotone this time.

2005-04-20  Jeremy Cowgar  <jeremy@cowgar.com>

	* commands.cc: Added maybe_show_multiple_heads, update now notifies
	  user of multiple heads if they exist, commit now notifies user
	  if their commit created a divergence.
	* tests/t_multiple_heads_msg.at: Added
	* testsuite.at: Added above test

2005-04-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Put $(wildcard) around "debian/*", so
	it will actually work.

2005-04-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Include tests, even when not building
	packages out in the source directory.

2005-04-20  Matthew Gregan  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>

	* commands.cc (kill_rev_locally): Move up with rest of non-CMD()
	functions.  Mark static.  Minor whitespace cleanup.
	* commands.hh (kill_rev_locally): Declaration not needed now.

2005-04-20 Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>
	* automate.cc: fix typo, add sanity check to avoid empty r_id's
	bein passed in. The automate version was bumped to 0.2 due to
	popular request of a single person.
	* t_automate_ancestors.at: adapt test; it passes now

2005-04-20 Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>
	* testuite.at:
	* t_automate_ancestors.at: new test; automate ancestors. This is still
	_failing_ as a) it outputs empty newlines when no ancestor exists and
	b) does not output all ancestors if multiple ids are supplied as input
	
2005-04-20 Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>

	* commands.cc:
	* automate.cc: new command: automate ancestors

	* tests/t_sticky_branch.at: Canonicalise stdout before comparison
	* tests/t_setup_checkout_modify_new_dir.at: Ditto
	* tests/t_netsync_largish_file.at: Check the file out rather
	than catting it, so that canonicalisation is unneeded.  
	Canonicalisation is bad here, because the file is random
	binary data, not text with line-ending conventions

2005-04-20  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/monotone.el: define-after-key's KEY argument has to be a
	vector with only one element.  The code I used is taken directly
	from the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, section "Modifying Menus".

2005-04-20  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	my_exit doesn't close any network connections.

	* testsuite.at (REVERT_TO): Make it possible to revert to a
	specific branch.  This is useful to resolve ambiguities.
	* tests/t_merge_add_del.at: Use it.

2005-04-17  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>

        If you have a file foo in your working dir (not monotone

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Take note of the change.
	* debian/docs: Distribute the contributions as well.
	* debian/compat, debian/files, debian/monotone.1: Remove, since
	they are self-generated by debhelper.  They were obviously added
	by mistake.

2005-04-13  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* cert.cc (guess_branch): Call app.set_branch.

	the branch name.
	(app_state::set_branch): No longer update the options map.
	(app_state::make_branch_sticky): New function which copies the
	stored branch name to the options map.  Only commands which call

	copy.

	* commands.cc (CMD(checkout)): Mark branch argument as sticky.
	(CMD(commit)): Likewise.
	(CMD(update)): Likewise.

	* monotone.texi (Working Copy): Mention that the "commit" and
	"update" commands update the stored default branch ("checkout"
	does, too, but this one should be obvious).

2005-04-12  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* rcs_import.cc (find_key_and_state): Fix stupid bug in storing the
	list of files a cvs_key contains.  CVS delta invariant failure now
	really fixed.  The rearrangement failure still exists, though.

2005-04-12  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>

	message.
	(ALIAS(ls)): Update help message.

2005-04-10  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/Notify.pl: Count the number of messages sent, and
	display the count at the end.
	Version bumped to 1.0.

2005-04-10  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* unix/inodeprint.cc, configure.ac: don't use the nsec time
	on non-Linux-style systems (quick compile fix for OS X and probably
	others, can be made generic later).

2005-04-10  Olivier Andrieu  <oliv__a@users.sourceforge.net>

	* contrib/monotone.el: Some elisp code for running monotone from
	inside Emacs. Supports diff, status, add, drop, revert and commit.

2005-04-09  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/Notify.pl: Allow globbing branches.  Make the revision
	records branch specific.  Show what records you would have updated
	even with --noupdate.  Add --before and --since, so users can
	select datetime ranges to create logs for.  Remove --to and add
	--difflogs-to and --nodifflogs-to to send logs with diffs to one
	address and logs without diffs to another (both can be given at
	once).  More and better documentation.

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* change_set.cc (basic_change_set): Remove problematic
	rename_dir/add combination, until directory semantics are
	fixed.

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* commands.cc (revert): Call maybe_update_inodeprints.
	* app_state.cc (set_restriction): Clear any old restrictions

2005-04-08  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* testsuite.at (NOT_ON_WIN32): Add a function to prevent tests from
	running on Win32 (for cases where the functionality being tested 
	makes no sense on Win32.  Not for cases where the functionality
	just isn't there yet on Win32.)
	* tests/t_final_space.at: Use NOT_ON_WIN32.  The filenames "a b" 
	and "a b " refer to the same file on Win32, obviating this test

2005-04-08  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* win32/inodeprint.cc (inodeprint_file): Still close the file if
	getting its time failed.
	* tests/t_netsync_sigpipe.at: Don't bother doing a kill -PIPE on
	Win32.  There is no real SIGPIPE on Win32 and sockets don't get this
	signal if their pipe goes away.  MinGW's kill seems to translate
	-PIPE to some signal that *does* kill monotone, so it seems like the
	easiest solution is just not to send the signal in the first place
	here.
	* tests/t_automate_ancestry_difference.at: Remove old 
	CHECK_SAME_STDOUT call which I'd left by accident.
	* tests/t_automate_leaves.at: Canonicalise monotone output before
	passing to CHECK_SAME_STDOUT

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* inodeprint.cc (operator<<): Typo.

	build_restricted_inodeprint_map): Remove unused functions.

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* work.cc: Remove doxygen comments.  Comments are good; comments
	that are longer than the function they document, and give less
	information, are not so good...

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* ChangeLog: Fixup after merge.

2005-04-08  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* commands.cc (calculate_current_revision): Defer to
	calculate_restricted_revision instead of special casing.

	inode signatures.

	* tests/t_inodeprints.at:
	* tests/t_inodeprints_update.at: Typoes.
	
	* work.cc (read_inodeprints): Typo.

	* UPGRADE: Document 0.17 -> 0.18 upgrade path.

2005-04-08  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* tests/t_cat_file_by_name.at: CHECK_SAME_STDOUT can only be used
	to check two 'cat' processes or two monotone processes on Win32,
	not to check monotone and 'cat'.  Change to go through an 
	intermediate stdout
	* tests/t_automate_erase_ancestors.at: Ditto
	* tests/t_automate_toposort.at: Ditto
	* tests/t_automate_ancestry_difference.at: Ditto

	* tests/t_empty_env.at: For Win32, copy libiconv-2.dll to the 
	current dir before the test, otherwise Win32 will search the
	(empty) path for it and not find it.
	* tests/t_automate_descendents.at: Ditto
	* win32/inodeprint.cc: Implement inodeprint_file for Win32, based
	on mode, device, size, create time and write time.
	
	
2005-04-08  Jon Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	* win32/inodeprint.cc: Change the function name to match the one

	calling conventions.
	* platform.hh (inodeprint_file): Likewise.
	* inodeprint.{cc,hh}: New files.
	* Makefile.am (MOST_SOURCES, UNIX_PLATFORM_SOURCES,
	WIN32_PLATFORM_SOURCES): Fixup accordingly.
	* vocab_terms.hh (inodeprint): New ATOMIC.
	* work.hh: Prototype inodeprint working copy functions.
	* work.cc: Implement them.

	* manifest.{hh,cc} (manifest_file_name): Remove unused variable.

2005-04-08  Jeremy Cowgar  <jeremy@cowgar.com>

	* doxygen.cfg: added
	* Makefile.am: added apidocs target (builds doxygen docs)

	* manifest.{hh,cc}: Remove some commented out unused functions.

	* win32/have_smart_terminal.cc: Include platform.hh.
	* unix/fingerprint.cc: New file, with new function.
	* win32/fingerprint.cc: New file, with stub function.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* manifest.hh, manifest.cc: Remove tabs.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* tests/t_final_space.at: New test.
	* testsuite.at: Add it.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* monotone.texi (Dealing with a Fork): 'merge' has slightly
	different output.

	* NEWS: Summarize changes of last 2.5 weeks.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* database.{cc,hh} (space_usage): New method.
	* database.cc (info): Use it.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* vocab.cc (verify): Cache known-good strings, to speed up
	repeated processing of related changesets.

	* change_set.cc (basic_change_set_test): Revert last change; the
	old version _was_ valid.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* smap.hh (insert): Fix stupid bug in assertion condition.

2005-04-07  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* change_set.cc (basic_change_set_test): Test a _valid_
	change_set.
	(directory_node): Make a std::map, instead of an smap.  Add a
	comment explaining the bug that makes this temporarily necessary.

	* smap.hh (smap): Don't check for duplicates at insert time,
	unless we've decided not to mark things damaged; don't return
	iterators from insert.  Do check for duplicates at sort time, and
	always sort, instead of sometimes doing linear search.  This makes
	insert O(1), while still preserving the invariant that keys must
	be unique.
	
	* commands.cc (commit): Explain why we're aborting, in the case
	that we detect that a file has changed under us in the middle of a
	commit.

2005-04-07  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

2005-04-06  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* work.cc (build_deletions): Issue warning when generating
	delete_dir's; they're totally broken, but I don't want to disable
	them, because then our tests won't see when they're fixed...

2005-04-05  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* tests/t_db_execute.at (db execute): New test.
	* testsuite.at: Add it.
	* database.cc (debug): Don't printf-interpret %-signs in input.

2005-04-05  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* database.cc: remove dulicated block introduced
	in rev 9ab3031f390769f1c455ec7764cc9c083f328a1b
	(merge of 76f4291b9fa56a04feb2186074a731848cced81c and
	c7917be7646df52363f39d2fc2f7d1198c9a8c27). Seems to be another
	instance of the case tested in t_merge_5.at

2005-04-05  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* basic_io.hh: reserve() the string which we're appending to
	frequently. Seems to give ~5% speedup in 
	diff -r t:revision-0.16 -r t:revision-0.17 - can't hurt.

2005-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* monotone.spec, debian/control: We no longer need external popt.

2005-04-04  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* file_io.cc (read_data_stdin): make it use botan
	* mkstemp.cc: merge cleanup (missed something up the manual merge)

2005-04-04  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* contrib/ciabot_monotone.py (config): Genericize again, so lazy
	people using it won't start sending commits for monotone.
	* .mt-attrs: Make it executable.

2005-04-04  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add the extra popt files.

	* popt/popt.3, popt/popt.ps, popt/testit.sh: Include a few more
	  files from popt, mostly to have documentation on hand.  post.ps
	  is mentioned in popt/README.

2005-04-03  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add contrib/ stuff to distributed
	files list.
	* contrib/ciabot_monotone.py (config.delivery): Turn on.

	* monotone.cc (my_poptStuffArgFile): Include the bundled popt.h.
	Since we now have a working popt, we can remove the restrictions
	on the use of -@.
	* tests/t_at_sign.at: Test that we can take more tha one -@.
	* monotone.1: Document it.

	* popt/poptint.h (struct poptContext_s): Add field to keep track
	  of the number of allocated leftovers elements.
	* popt/popt.c (poptGetContext): Initialise it and use it.
	  (poptGetNextOpt): Use it and realloc leftovers when needed.
	  Also make sure that the added element is a dynamically allocated
	  copy of the original string, or we may end up with a dangling
	  pointer.  These are huge bugs in popt 1.7, when using
	  poptStuffArgs().
	  (poptFreeContext): Free the leftovers elements when freeing
	  leftovers.
	  (poptSaveLong, poptSaveInt): Apply a small patch from Debian.

	* popt/CHANGES, popt/COPYING, popt/README, popt/findme.c,

	  makes better use of some new monotone automate features.  It's
	  also better organised and much more documented.

	* tests/t_dropkey_2.at: Updated to test dropkey instead of delkey
	* tests/t_dropkey_1.at: Updated to test dropkey instead of delkey

	  to dropkey
	  (Commands): Changed references to delkey to dropkey

	  command consistency (with existing drop command)

2005-04-01  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.cc (my_poptStuffArgFile): An argument file might be
	empty, and therefore contain no arguments to be parsed.  That's
	OK.
	* tests/t_at_sign.at: Test it.

2005-04-01  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* monotone.cc: Fixup after merge.

	* commands.cc (commit): Fix typo.
	
	* monotone.texi (Making Changes): Don't claim that writing to

	later.

	  app_state.cc (app_state::set_depth): ... and the field and
	  method to store and set it.
	* commands.cc (CMD(log)): ... then handle it.

	* tests/t_log_depth.at: Add a test for 'log --depth=n'
	* testsuite.at: Add it.
	* monotone.texi (Informative): Document it.

2005-03-31  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* automate.cc (automate_erase_ancestors): Accept zero arguments,
	and in such case print nothing.  (Important for scripting.)
	* commands.cc (automate):
	* monotone.texi (Automation):
	* tests/t_automate_erase_ancestors.at: Update accordingly.

2005-03-31  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* automate.cc (automate_toposort): Accept zero arguments, and in
	such case print nothing.  (Important for scripting.)
	* commands.cc (automate):
	* monotone.texi (Automation):
	* tests/t_automate_toposort.at: Update accordingly.

2005-03-30  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* contrib/Notify.pl: A new Perl hack to send change logs by
	email.

	* contrib/README: Add a quick description.

	* testsuite.at: Add them.
	
	* revision.cc (calculate_ancestors_from_graph): Do not keep an
	"interesting" set and return only ancestors from this set;
	instead, simply return all ancestors.  Returning a limited set of
	ancestors does not speed things up, nor reduce memory usage in
	common cases.  (The only time it would reduce memory usage is when
	examining only a small ancestor set, which the important case,
	'heads', does not; even then, erase_ancestors would need to intern
	the interesting revisions first so they got low numbers, which it
	doesn't.)
	(erase_ancestors): Adjust accordingly.
	(toposort, ancestry_difference): New functions.
	* revision.hh (toposort, ancestry_difference): Declare.
	* automate.cc (automate_toposort, automate_ancestry_difference):

	its output is alphabetically or topologically sorted.

2005-03-25  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

        * {unix,win32}/platform_netsync.cc, platform.hh, Makefile.am: new
        functions to disable and enable sigpipe.
        * netsync.cc, main.cc: call the functions from netsync rather than
        globally, so that sigpipe still works for piping output of commands
        such as 'log'.
        * tests/t_netsync_sigpipe.at: test it.
        * testsuite.at: add it.

2005-03-25  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* tests/t_database_check.at: re-encode the manifestX
	data so that it doesn't use any fancy gzip features like
	filenames (so that the botan parse can handle it).
	( if it should be able to handle it, an additional test
	can be added testing it explicitly).

2005-03-25  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* botan/base64.h: Change default break value so that

	* netsync.cc: Remove a few tabs.

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* win32/process.cc (process_spawn): Now takes 
	const char * const argv[]
	* unix/process.cc (process_spawn): Ditto.  Cast for call to
	execvp
	(existsonpath): Initialise args in a const way

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* win32/process.cc (process_spawn): Now takes 
	char * const argv[]
	* platform.hh (process_spawn): Ditto
	* unix/process.cc (process_spawn): Ditto
	* lua.cc (monotone_spawn_for_lua): Remove debug code
	* General: Beginning to hate C++'s const rules

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* win32/process.cc (process_spawn): Now takes 
	const char * const *
	* platform.hh (process_spawn): Ditto
	* unix/process.cc (process_spawn): Ditto
	* General: Sorry about all these commits, I'm syncing back and
	forth between Linux and Win32

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* win32/process.cc (process_spawn): Now takes char * const *
	* platform.hh (process_spawn): Ditto
	* unix/process.cc (process_spawn): Ditto
	(existsonpath): argv now const char*[]

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* win32/process.cc: Added forgotten file
	* unix/process.cc: Include stat.h, (process_*) fix compilation
	errors

2005-03-04  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* unix/process.cc: Added forgotten file

2005-03-03  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* lposix.c: Deleted
	* win32/process.cc: Created, added Win32 versions of functions
	existsonpath, make_executable, process_spawn, process_wait,
	process_kill, process_sleep
	* unix/process.cc: Ditto, for the Unix versions.
	* lua.cc: Add LUA wrappers for the above functions, register
	them with LUA
	* std_hooks.lua (execute, attr_functions->execute, 
	program_exists_in_path): Use the new functions instead of posix
	functions
	* t_can_execute.at (touchhook.lua): Ditto

2005-03-01  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* app_state.cc (set_restriction): actually ignore ignored files
	rather than trying to validate them

2005-03-01  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* tests/t_diff_binary.at: new test (bug report)
	* tests/t_command_completion.at: new test
	* tests/t_merge_rename_file_and_rename_dir.at: new test
	* testsuite.at: include new tests
	
2005-02-28  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* Makefile.am (BUILT_SOURCES_CLEAN): Moved mt-stding.h from here...
	(DISTCLEANFILES): ... to here.  Since mt-stding.h is created by
	config.status, it should only be removed by the distclean target.

2005-02-28  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* std_hooks.lua: posix.iswin32() == 1, rather than plain boolean
	comparison (0 doesn't compare as false in lua it seems).

2005-02-27  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* lposix.c (win32 Pspawn): Search the path
	(win32 Pexistsonpath): Added.  'which' isn't easily available,
	and not available at all from a normal Win32 command shell
	(Piswin32): Added a function for both Unix and Win32 to detect
	if running on Windows
	* std_hooks.lua (program_exists_in_path): Now calls 
	posix.iswin32.  If win32, calls posix.existsonpath, otherwise
	calls which as it always did.

2005-02-27  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* lposix.c (win32 Pspawn): Remove dumb strlen bug resulting in
	AVs on commit.

2005-02-27  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* t_can_execute.at: Test to see if hooks can execute things
	* testsuite.at: Add t_can_execute

2005-02-27  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* lposix.c (win32 Pspawn): Ensure the command string is always
	NUL-terminated.  Also, allocate enough memory for the quotes
	around the command string.

2005-02-27  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* xdelta.cc (unittests): Define BOOST_STDC_NO_NAMESPACE, needed
	to compile with the latest MinGW which uses gcc 3.4.2
	* vocab.cc (verify(local_path)): Catch fs::filesystem_error too
	and rethrow this as an informative_failure, thereby fixing the
	Win32 unit tests without disabling anything
	* idna/toutf8.c (stringprep_convert): Fix a potential segfault
	when memory allocation fails.  Potentially security-relevant.
	* tests/t_i18n_file.at: Add a SET_FUNNY_FILENAME macro, which 
	gets a platform-appropriate funny filename (with/without 
	colon).  
	Change references to utf8 to utf-8, iso88591 to iso-8859-1, and
	eucjp to euc-jp, on the grounds that MinGW's iconv knows all
	of the latter and none of the former, but Linux iconv knows all
	of them.  Test now passes one Win32.  I'm presuming we weren't
	deliberately using non-standard names for charsets here.
	* tests/t_i18n_changelog.at: Same charset name changes.
	* tests/t_dump_load.at: Canonicalise dump before loading it
	* tests/t_load_into_existing.at: Ditto
	* tests/t_fmerge.at: Canonicalise fmerge output
	* tests/t_merge_normalization_edge_case.at: Ditto
	* tests/t_unidiff.at: Canonicalise diff output
	* tests/t_largish_file.at: Instead of using dd, which MinGW
	doesn't have, I've generated the file with dd on a nearby Linux
	box, then gziped and b64ed it, and the test case now generates
	it with UNGZB64
	* testsuite.at: Add a comment every 10 tests with the test
	number.  Useful if you're trying to locate which test number
	you're trying to run and only have the filename.  If people 
	hate this, though, please do delete.
	(UNB64_COMMAND) Do special handling for Win32 to avoid
	having to canonicalise the file.
	(UNGZ_COMMAND) Canonicalise the file after ungzipping it.
	* lposix.c: (Pfork, Pexec) Removed, on the grounds that we only
	really want to support fork+exec as a single operation.  fork()
	without exec() could be risky with a child process also having
	our sqlite handles, etc.  exec() could be risky since we 
	wouldn't be exiting gracefully, just dying in the middle of a
	hook.
	(Pspawn) Implemented for both Win32 and Unix.  Does fork/exec
	for Unix, CreateProcess for Win32.  Returns -1 on error, pid on
	success in both cases.
	(Pwait, Pkill, Psleep) Implemented for Win32.  Note that pid is
	not optional for Pwait on Win32.
	* std_hooks.lua: (execute) Now uses spawn()

2005-02-25  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* ChangeLog: Add all my previous changes.
	* tests/t_add_owndb.at: Add test for trying to add the db to
	itself.
	* testsuite.at: Call it
	* tests/t_automate_heads.at: Canonicalise stdout output.
	* tests/t_automate_version.at: Use arithmetic comparison against
	wc output instead of string comparison, to avoid problems with
	MinGW's wc, which outputs with initial space-padding
	* tests/t_change_empty_file.at: Canonicalise stdout output 
	and compare manually instead of letting autotest check it
	* tests/t_fmerge_normalize.at: Canonicalise stdout output.
	* tests/t_netsync_single.at: Use NETSYNC_KILLHARD instead of 
	killall, as for the NETSYNC functions in testsuite.at

2005-02-27  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

        * main.cc: ignore SIGPIPE so that monotone won't be killed
        unexpectedly upon remote disconnection for netsync

2005-02-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* idna/idn-int.h: Oops, really add this time.

2005-02-27  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* AUTHORS: Add Corey Halpin.
	
	* idna/idn-int.h: New file (don't generate from configure anymore,
	but just ship).
	* configure.ac: Don't generate idna/idn-int.h.  Do generate
	mt-stdint.h.
	* Makefile.am: Adjust for idna/idn-int.h and mt-stdint.h.
	* acinclude.m4: Remove AX_CREATE_STDINT_H, ACX_PTHREAD,
	AC_COMPILE_CHECK_SIZEOF (let aclocal pick them up from m4/
	instead).
	* m4/ax_create_stdint_h.m4:
	* m4/acx_pthread.m4: Update from http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/
	
	* numeric_vocab.hh: Instead of dancing around which header to
	include, include mt-stdint.h.
	
	* app_state.cc (restriction_includes, set_restriction): Move
	global static 'dot' into these functions, because file_path
	depends on global book_keeping_dir being initialized already, and
	there is no guaranteed order of initialization of C++ statics.
	(Bug reported by Matt Johnston.)
	
2005-02-27  Corey Halpin  <chalpin@cs.wisc.edu>

	* numeric_vocab.hh: Try both stdint.h and inttypes.h.
	* main.cc: OpenBSD has Unix signals too.

2005-02-26  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* file_io.cc (absolutify): normalize fs::path to remove ..'s
	* tests/t_db_with_dots.at: ensure database path in MT/options
	doesn't contain ..'s

2005-02-25  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* ChangeLog: Add all my previous changes.
	* tests/t_add_owndb.at: Add test for trying to add the db to

2005-02-25  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* vocab.cc (test_file_path_verification): Re-enable some tests
	disabled by Jon Bright, following discussion on IRC concluding
	that they were catching a real bug.

2005-02-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* tests/t_add_dot.at: Run "add ." in a subdirectory, so as not to
	add the test database.  (Reported by Jon Bright.)

	* AUTHORS: Fix gettext.h copyright note, to not be in the middle
	of libidn copyright note.
	Add Jon Bright.

2005-02-24  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>

	* app_state.cc (prefix): Use string() instead of 
	native_directory_string().  For Unix, these should be equivalent.
	For Win32, I believe string()'s correct (since we compare 
	everywhere against normalized paths with / characters, but 
	native_directory_string produces paths with \ characters on Win32.
	* rcs_file.cc (file_source): Map the map, not the mapping.
	* tests/t_i18n_file.at: Remove colon from filename with symbols.
	I need to return to this and add a proper test for Win32, so we
	only use the colon on non-Win32.
	* testsuite.at: Add a CANONICALISE function, which does nothing
	on Unix and strips out carriage returns from files on Win32.  This
	is useful for being able to compare Monotone's stdout output to
	files on disk.  Add NETSYNC_KILL and NETSYNC_KILLHARD functions,
	to deal with MinGW not having killall (Unix still uses killall,
	though).
	* tests/t_import.at: Add CANONICALISE calls before comparing
	stdout output.
	* tests/t_netsync.at: Likewise
	* tests/t_netsync_single.at: Likewise
	* tests/t_scan.at: Likewise
	* tests/t_versions.at: Likewise
	* tests/t_ls_missing.at: Likewise.  Also, generate missingfoo and
	missingbar files with expected output from ls missing for these
	files being missing and compare against those.

2005-02-24  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* app_state.{cc,hh} (add_restriction): rename to ...
	(set_restriction) this; and add path validation

	(get_path_rearrangement) remove restricted include/exclude variant
	(calculate_restricted_revision) get valid paths and use to set up
	restriction
	(status, ls_unknown, commit, do_diff) pass args to
	calculate_restricted_revision to valid restriction paths
	(ls_missing, revert) get valid paths and use to set up restriction
	* tests/t_checkout_options.at: remove bug report priority (it's
	fixed!)
	* tests/t_diff_added_file.at: add --revision options to diff
	* tests/t_restrictions.at: remove invalid paths from ls unknown
	and ls ignored
	* tests/t_restrictions_warn_on_unknown.at: un-XFAIL
	
2005-02-23  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

2005-02-23  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>
	
	* vocab.cc (test_file_path_verification): Disable foo//nonsense
	test for Win32, add tests for UNC paths.  This was the only
	failing unit test on Win32.

2005-02-23  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>

	* txt2c.cc (main): Don't claim the file was generated from 
	--strip-trailing if that option's used.

2005-02-23  Jon Bright  <jon@siliconcircus.com>

	* app_state.cc: Add include of io.h for Win32, for chdir()
	* file_io.cc (get_homedir): Correct assertion (remove bracket)
	* lua/lposix.c, lua/modemuncher.c: Remove all references to
	functions and modes that don't exist on Win32.
	* monotone.cc: Include libintl.h on Win32
	
2005-02-21  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* file_io.cc (get_homedir): Add more comments and logging to Win32
	version.  Also, only check HOME under Cygwin/MinGW.

2005-02-21  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* Makefile.am: merge fixup
	
2005-02-21  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* std_hooks.lua (merge2, merge3): Check for DISPLAY before
	invoking gvim.

2005-02-20  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	trailing whitespace.  While here, fix a date by adding zeros before
	the month and the day number.

	* gettext.h: Add file.
	* AUTHORS: Mention that it comes from the GNU Gettext package.
	* Makefile.am: Distribute it.
	* sanity.hh: Use gettext.h rather than libintl.h so that --disable-nls
	works.  Also improves portability, according to the GNU Gettext
	manual.

	* automate.cc (automate_heads): remove bogus call to 
	app.allow_working_copy() which is called in cpp_main
	* database.cc (check_sqlite_format_version): don't check database
	version when "file" is really a directory; add filename to error
	message
	(sql): check for empty database early, even though this seems
	impossible as absolutify changes "" into path to working dir;
	convert to use N-style assertions; add check to ensure "file" is
	not really a directory

2005-02-17  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* app_state.{cc,hh} (app_state): initialize search root

2005-02-16  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* monotone.texi: Fix a typo (hexidecimal to hexadecimal).  Also
	change an example command to append stuff to ~/.monotonerc, instead
	of completely destroying the possibily existing file.  Addresses
	bug #11136.

2005-02-16  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* cryptopp/config.h: Use uint{8,16,32,64}_t as size types instead of

	This does not yet use any of the more sophisticated API features

	* commands.cc: Make the 'log' command show nothing for renamed or
	deleted files (when asked to do so) and stop going backwards in
	history when such condition is detected; they don't exist any more,
	so there is no point in showing history (and could drive to incorrect

	and deleted files with deltas.

2004-12-29  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* testsuite.at, tests/t_netsync_single.at: don't use -q with
	killall since it isn't portable.

2004-12-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* commands.cc: Make the 'log' command show all affected files
	in each revision in a nice format (easier to read than what
	'cat revision' shows).

2004-12-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* commands.cc: Change the order used by the 'log' command to show
	affected files so that it matches the order in which these changes
	really happen.  Otherwise, a sequence like "rm foo; mv bar foo;
	patch foo" could be difficult to understand by the reader.

2004-12-28  Jordi Vilalta Prat  <jvprat@wanadoo.es>

	* monotone.texi: Fix a typo: "not not" should be "not".

2004-12-28  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* revision.{cc,hh}: Likewise.
	Teach about generalized graph rebuilding.
	* database.cc (delete_existing_revs_and_certs): New fn.
	* commands.cc (db rebuild): New command.
	(db fsck) New command.
	* sanity.{cc,hh} (relaxed): New flag.
	* work.cc: Use new concatenation logic.

2004-12-25  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* commands.cc: During 'log', print duplicate certificates (by
	different people) in separate lines, rather than showing them
	together without any spacing.  While here, homogenize new lines
	in other messages as well; this also avoids printing some of
	them in case of missing certificates).

2004-12-24  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* tests/t_disapprove.at: Enable previously disabled test.

2004-12-22  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* commands.cc: Verify that the key identifier passed to the pubkey
	and privkey commands exists in the database.  Otherwise exit with
	an informational message instead of an exception.

2004-12-20  Matt Johnston  <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* tests/t_netsync.at:
	* tests/t_netsync_single.at:
	* tests/t_revert.at:
	* tests/t_tags.at: Avoid usage of test's == operator.  It's a
	GNUism and causes unexpected failures in many tests.  The correct
	operator to use is just an equal sign (=).
	* tests/t_renamed.at: Don't use cp's -a flag, which is not
	supported by some implementations of this utility (such as the
	one in NetBSD).  Try to add some of its funcionality by using
	the -p flag, although everything could be fine without it.
	* tests/t_unidiff.at: Discard patch's stderr output.  Otherwise
	it's treated as errors, but NetBSD's patch uses it to print
	informative messages.

2004-12-19  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* tests/t_scan.at: Instead of running sha1sum, use a prestored

	* ChangeLog: Add log entry for <jmmv@NetBSD.org>'s last change.

2004-12-18  Julio M. Merino Vidal  <jmmv@NetBSD.org>

	* commands.cc: Include cerrno, cstring,
	boost/filesystem/exception.hpp.
	(checkout): Verify that directory creation and chdir succeeded.

2004-12-18  Nathaniel Smith  <njs@codesourcery.com>

	* diff_patch.cc (struct hunk_offset_calculator): Remove dead
	code.  (I believe it was used by the old, non-extent-based
	merging.)
	(calculate_hunk_offsets): Likewise.
	(struct hunk_consumer): Move next to rest of unidiff code.
	(walk_hunk_consumer): Likewise.

2004-12-18  Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>

	* change_set.cc (concatenate_change_sets): Be more careful checking
	whether to discard deltas for deleted files (in particular take
	care when files are removed then re-added) - fixes tests
	t_patch_drop_add, t_add_drop_add.at, t_add_patch_drop_add,
	t_merge2_add_drop_add
	* change_set.cc (project_missing_deltas): don't copy deltas
	for deleted files, and handle the case where src file ids vary when
	files are added/removed. (fixes t_patch_vs_drop_add)
	* t_patch_drop_add.at, t_add_drop_add.at, t_add_patch_drop_add.at,
	  t_merge2_add_drop_add.at, t_patch_vs_drop_add.t: don't expect

	argument:
	* revision.cc (is_ancestor): New method.

2004-10-17  Derek Scherger  <derek@echologic.com>

	* lua.{cc,hh} (hook_ignore_branch): new hook
	* commands.cc (ls_branches): call it
	* monotone.texi (Hook Reference): describe it

2004-10-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	fix bug 8715 and more
	* diff_patch.cc (struct unidiff_hunk_writer,
	unidiff_hunk_writer::flush_hunk): the skew is not just the
	size difference between added and deleted lines in the current
	hunk, it's the size difference between /all/ added and deleted
	lines so far.  Therefore, the skew needs to be a member of the
	struct rather than being something calculated for each hunk.
	Furthermore, we need to add trailing context even if the change
	only consisted of one line.

2004-10-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.texi (Working Copy): Change the description of
	'monotone revert' to explain what happens when there are
	arguments.

2004-10-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	* monotone.texi (OPTIONS): Add a description of --ticker.

	* ui.cc, ui.hh: Rethink the writing conditions as the ticks being
	"dirty" when they have changed since the last print.  That way,
	it's very easy to see when they need being printed.  This fixes a
	small bug where, in some cases, the exact same tick output is
	produced twice, once before a separate message, and once after,
	when a ticker is actually being removed.
	(tick_write_dot::write_ticks): Add a line that describes the
	ticks, including the amount of each tick per short name.

2004-10-17  Richard Levitte  <richard@levitte.org>

	fix bug 8733
	* ui.cc, ui.hh: Define a separate tick writer struct, and two
	subclasses, one that write counters, and one that writes progress
	characters.  As a consequence, move the count to the ticker class
	itself, and have the user interface contain a map of pointers to
	tickers instead of a map of counters, so data is easier to expand
	and access in a consistent manner.  Finally, correct a few errors
	in the checks for when ticks should be written, and make sure the
	final value gets written when the tickers are removed.

	* cert.cc (write_ancestry_paths):
	* database.cc (rehash):
	* netsync.cc (call_server, rebuild_merkle_trees):
	* rcs_import.cc (import_cvs_repo, cvs_history): Adapt to the new
	tickers.

	* monotone.cc: Add the option '--ticker' which takes the values
	"dot" or "count" to express which type of tick writer to use.  As
	a result, set the tick writer to be the progress dot kind or the
	counting type.

2004-10-15  Graydon Hoare  <graydon@pobox.com>

	* std_hooks.lua (get_revision_cert_trust): Add.
