Compiling on Windows using Cygwin:

An official Cygwin package for monotone and all its dependencies is
usually available soon after release; just run the Cygwin installer
and install the 'monotone' package.

To build Monotone on Cygwin for development and testing, the following
packages are required (the versions listed are known to work; they may
not be the exact versions used to build the official Cygwin package).
Note that the monotone source code is compatible with Lua 5.2, but (as
of 23 Apr 2014), Cygwin only has Lua 5.1. Monotone is also compatible
with multiple versions of botan and Cygwin provides two variants that
both work.

   binutils-2.24.51
   automake-1.14
   autoconf2.5-2.69
   make-4.0
   libboost-devel-1.53.0
   botan-devel-1.8.14 or botan1.10-devel-1.10.5
   gcc-g++-4.8.2
   gettext-devel-0.18.1
   libidn-devel-1.26
   libpcre-devel-8.34
   libsqlite3-devel-3.8.4.1
   lua-5.1.5-1
   zlib-devel-1.2.8

If you use botan-1.10, please pass the following options to configure:

   ./configure botan_CFLAGS="-I/usr/include/botan-1.10" \
               botan_LIBS="/usr/lib/libbotan-1.10.dll.a"

No special options are needed for configure if botan-devel (i.e. 1.8)
is used.

There is a bug in the bash builtin 'pwd' in bash 4.1; it can return
'c:/' syntax for absolute paths in some circumstances. See
http://sourceware.org/ml/cygwin/2002-11/msg01111.html. In particular,
this happens when starting a bash shell under Emacs, which results in
configure creating Makefiles with some problems. A work-around is to
put 'cd `/bin/pwd`' in your ~/.emacs_bash.

See cygport/README for building a Cygwin package.
