See INSTALL for general notes, such as running 'make' and 'make check'

on Windows (using Cygwin):

Monotone needs the following packages to compile:
(newer releases are usually ok)

 Runtime requirements:
   cygwin-1.7.0-60
   libgcc1-4.3.2-2
   libidn11-1.9-1
   libintl8-0.17-11
   libpcre0-7.9-1
   libsqlite3_0-3.6.2-1
   libstdc++6-4.3.2-2
   lua-5.1.4-11
   zlib0-1.2.3-10

 Build requirements:
   gcc4-4.3.2
   binutils-2.19.51
   boost-devel-1.33.1
   libsqlite3-devel-3.6.2
   libidn-devel-1.9
   gettext-devel-0.17
   zlib-1.2.3
   perl-5.10.0
   botan-1.8.2

currently every prerequisite is available as packages except
lua and botan which are only available in Cygwin 1.7;
an official Cygwin package for monotone and all its
dependencies is usually available soon after release.

The following is needed to succesfully configure:
 export CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/include/boost-1_33_1/"; configure

Easiest way to create a Cygwin package is using cygport
(which must be installed separately as a Cygwin package)
and upgrade the previous version cygport file; you can fetch
latest version from the maintainer's own repository:

% mtn pull lapo.it it.lapo.cygwin.ports
% mtn checkout -b it.lapo.cygwin.ports cygwin
% cd cygwin
% mtn mv monotone-$OLD-1.cygport monotone-$NEW-1.cygport
proceed to change or fix the port and/or the patch as needed
% cygport monotone-$NEW-1 all
