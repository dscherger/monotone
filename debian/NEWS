monotone (0.31-90.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * "mtn serve" doesn't take any mandatory arguments any more.  Instead
    of specifying branches to serve (or to exclude) on the command line,
    mtn now entirely trusts the netsync permission hooks called
    get_netsync_read_permitted and get_netsync_write_permitted.

    If you have any "mtn serve" still running with branches given on the
    command line, you will need to remove those and work on the hooks.
    If you just have the argument "*", it can safely be removed.  Not
    doing so will cause your server to stop working.

monotone (0.31-90.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Another efficiency change.  You need to do the following on each
    of your databases (except for the server database handled by the
    monotone-server package, for which this is done automatically):

        mtn db migrate
        # ... possibly other commands, depending on how old your previous
        #     mtn version was
        mtn db regenerate_caches

    This does NOT affect remote participants of your projects, the
    changes are only local.

monotone (0.30-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Efficiency changes have been implemented, which changes the rosters
    (and internal file description structure).  It means that you will
    have to do the following on each of your databases (except for the
    server database handled by the monotone-server package, for which
    this is done automatically):

        mtn db migrate
        # ... possibly other commands, depending on how old your previous
        #     mtn version was
        mtn db regenerate_rosters

    This does NOT affect remote participants of your projects, the
    changes are only local.

monotone (0.30-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * [this is copied from the normal monotone NEWS file]

        In this release, there is a minor change to the format of the
        data stored in the bookkeeping directory "_MTN".  You must run
        the command "mtn migrate_workspace" in all your existing
        workspaces before you can use them with this version of
        monotone; once you have done this, you will not be able to use
        those workspaces with older versions of monotone.  Nothing
        terrible will happen if you try to use an old workspace
        without migrating it; you'll just get an error message.

        This change makes it possible for a workspace to have more
        than one parent revision, which will enable a number of
        long-wanted features.  Those features are not yet complete,
        but we do not expect to have to change formats again to
        support them.
