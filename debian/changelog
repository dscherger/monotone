monotone (0.40-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Backport from upstream development tree:
    - fix for broken ssh_agent support
    - testsuite hardening against unusable network, and DISABLE_NETWORK_TESTS
      environment variable support
    - improved contrib/dump-test-logs.sh
  * debian/rules: Set DISABLE_NETWORK_TESTS when running the testsuite;
    this may cure the mips buildd problems for real.  Also, implement
    support for DEB_BUILD_OPTS=parallel rather than probing available CPUs.
  * monotone binary package Suggests: monotone-doc and monotone-server
    (Closes: #476155)

  * Corrected .diff.gz including regeneration of Makefile.in.
    (Closes: #483090, #483018)
  * monotone-server.postinst, monotone-doc.postinst: help out dpkg
    with directory->symlink conversion.  (Closes: #483155)

    them from /usr/share/doc/monotone/..., per Policy 12.3.

monotone (0.40-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Automatically skip all tests involving netsync if it is impossible
    to use TCP on the loopback interface.  (Closes: #474280)
  * If the testsuite fails, dump the per-test logs for all failed
    testcases into the main build log.

  * Install HTML documentation in /usr/share/doc/monotone/html, not
    /usr/share/doc/html.  (Closes: #480072)
  * Make /usr/share/doc/monotone-server and /usr/share/doc/monotone-doc
    symlinks to /usr/share/doc/monotone; do not ship any files in those
    packages that are also in the main monotone package.  This requires
    adding a dependency of monotone-doc on monotone.
  * Register monotone manual with doc-base.
  * Improve description of monotone-doc package.

monotone (0.39-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-dependency on patch (not dpatch) restored; it was accidentally
    removed in 0.39-1 along with dpatch.  The test suite uses it.
  * Various vestiges of dpatch use removed from debian/rules.

  [ Zack Weinberg ]
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #473252.
    - Can now be built with gcc 4.3 snapshots.  (Closes: #455646)
  * Enable use of system libpcre, set appropriate Build-Depends.

  [ Richard Levitte ]
  * The patch to disable the SIGPIPE test isn't needed any more.
  * Build-dependency on dpatch dropped again, as it is unused.

monotone (0.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Richard Levitte ]
  * New upstream release.
  * The log_quits_on_SIGPIPE test malfunctions on Linux.  Add a temporary
    patch disabling it on Debian, giving upstream a chance to fix the
    problem while being able to build the Debian package without trouble.

  [ Zack Weinberg ]
  * monotone-server.postrm: Delete default.mtn~ on purge.
    (Closes: #455058)
  * Add Homepage: and Vcs-Browser: fields to debian/control.
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).

monotone (0.37-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Turn compiler optimization back on by default.  Doh!
    Hopefully this shrinks hppa builds to the point where we don't need
    -mlong-calls.  Since the accidental use of -O0 in 0.37-[23] seems to
    have been responsible for the unexpected successful builds on Alpha,
    try -O1 on that architecture.  Implement DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt while
    we're at it.
  * Backport upstream's relicensing of the manual under the GPL, since
    we (and upstream) may technically have been violating the GFDL by
    not including its text in the manual proper.  Source and binary
    packages now contain no content not distributable under GPLv2 or a
    more permissive license.
  * debian/copyright: Point specifically to GPLv2 (upstream specifies
    GPLv2-or-later, let's not be exercising the 'or later' part unless
    and until they do).  Fix typo.

 -- Zack Weinberg <zackw@panix.com>  Mon, 26 Nov 2007 17:01:18 -0800

monotone (0.37-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not error out if $HOME exists but is inaccessible.  Should fix
    mips(el) FTBFS.
  * Fix bashisms in monotone-server scripts.  Thanks to Glen Ditchfield
    for finding this problem and providing part of the fix.
  * In monotone-server.postinst, set permissions and ownership of
    just-created directories whether or not we created the monotone
    user.  Thanks to Michael Berg for doing almost all the work on
    this bug.  (Closes: #437978)
  * Reincorporate debian/changelog entries for versions 0.27-1 and
    0.27-1.1.  These versions were once uploaded to Debian but their
    entries got lost from the official changelog somehow.
  * Switch from cdbs to a handwritten rules file based on debhelper
    examples.  Restore Build-Depends/Build-Depends-Indep distinction
    and monkey with the rules so that dpkg-buildpackage -B doesn't
    build the documentation.  This gets us out from under the present
    nonavailability of some of the B-D-Is on some of the buildds.
  * Info files moved to monotone-doc.  Other cleanups to that package.
  * Do not install the boilerplate ABOUT-NLS file in any of the
    packages' documentation directories.
  * Improve short descriptions.

monotone (0.37-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Clarifications to debian/copyright and AUTHORS.
  * No longer depends on any external Boost library modules.
    And there was much rejoicing.
  * Ensure sqlite I/O code sees a prototype for pread/pwrite, and make
    it enable large file support correctly.  This is believed to be
    the cause of the multi-platform FTBFS, but has only been confirmed
    to be so on powerpc.  Please file new FTBFS bugs for any remaining
    architectures that are broken.  (Closes: #439584)

monotone (0.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Richard Levitte ]
  * New upstream release.

  [ Zack Weinberg ]
  * Bump debhelper build-dep to (>= 4.2.0) per cdbs docs.
  * Run testsuite during build.
  * Drop libboost-filesystem-dev build-dependency.
  * monotone-server.postinst, monotone-server.postrm: Do not assume
    full pathnames of ucf or adduser.  Use ucfr as well as ucf.
    At purge time:
     - do not assume ucf, adduser, or debconf are available (closes: #434604).
     - if not asked to manage the database, do not delete it.
     - if deleting the database and there is a hot journal, delete that too.
     - delete editor backups of ucf-managed conffiles.
     - expunge the auto-generated key's passphrase from
       /etc/monotone/passphrases and if that leaves the file empty,
       delete it.
     - do not delete the monotone user or group if leaving /var/lib/monotone
       on the filesystem.
  * Bump boost build-deps to (>= 1.34.1-2) for packaging changes that make
    the configure script find the single-threaded version of
    libboost-regex.
  * Re-enable -DBOOST_SP_DISABLE_THREADS; the above should render it
    unnecessary.  This eliminates the sole divergence from upstream.
  * Correct invalid assumption in tests/invalid_--root_settings that
    the build directory is not a subdirectory of /tmp.
  * Build-depend on patch, for the sake of the testsuite.

 -- Zack Weinberg <zackw@panix.com>  Wed, 22 Aug 2007 15:06:51 -0700

  * Enable parallel make on multiprocessors.

  [ Ludovic Brenta ]
  * monotone-server.postrm: do not blindly erase /var/lib/monotone on

    texinfo's suggested packages, to ensure docs build. (Closes: #422936)
  * New Dutch template translation (Closes: #415496).
  * Add build-dep on po-debconf to ensure correct construction of

  * Simplify the rules file a bit.

  [ Richard Levitte ]
