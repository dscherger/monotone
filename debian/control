Description: A distributed version (revision) control system
 Monotone is a free, distributed version control system. It provides
 fully disconnected operation, manages complete tree versions, keeps
 its state in a local transactional database, supports overlapping
 branches and extensible metadata, exchanges work over plain network
 protocols, performs history-sensitive merging, and delegates trust
 functions to client-side RSA certificates.
