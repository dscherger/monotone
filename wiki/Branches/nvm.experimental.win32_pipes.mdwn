`mtn sync file:` and `mtn sync ssh:` do _not_ work reliably on Windows [[MinGW]].

The core problem is that Win32 does not support `select` on pipes.

This branch attempts to replace Win32 pipes by sockets.

It fails, because ssh doesn't create sockets when it runs mtn.

See comments in netxx_pipe.hh

Status: [[status/Stalled]]; use Cygwin instead, where things just work.
