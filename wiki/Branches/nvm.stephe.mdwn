Random small jobs.

Add --reverse option for 'diff', to specify direction for diffs involving the workspace; landed.

Fix 'conflict' to handle directories, add 'keep' resolution.

Strategy: write tests that break, fix code till they pass.

Status: [[status/Work_In_Progress]] tests passing; ready to land. Need to merge from main first.
