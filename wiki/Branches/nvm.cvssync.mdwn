Adds two-way syncing with (remote) CVS servers

Christof (and his collegues) use this branch for their daily work against their CVS servers, so it's definitely usable. Documentation is available.

Open issues: the data structure (map<time,...>) has difficulties and is inefficient for large (>1000 changesets) repositories; propagates gather too much changelog info; most problems arise when $Id$ tags get expanded differently; not yet reindented with GNU style.
