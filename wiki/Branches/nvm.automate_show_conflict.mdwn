Provide simple flow to resolve non-content conflicts.

Strategy: Add `automate show_conflicts`, to aid in determining how to resolve the conflicts. Then add options to merge to specify how to resolve the conflicts.

Status: Just started; `automate show_conflicts` works for "file added on left and right" case. Need to add all other conflict cases.
