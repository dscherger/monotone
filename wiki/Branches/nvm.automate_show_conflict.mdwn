Provide simple flow to resolve non-content conflicts.

Strategy: Add `automate show_conflicts`, to aid in determining how to
resolve the conflicts. Then add options to merge to specify how to
resolve the conflicts.

Status: [[status/Stalled]] 'automate show_conflicts' completed May
2008; merged to main. Started work on file sutures, to provide true
resolution of duplicate name conflicts. Abandoned August 2008; way too
much work. Branch nvm.resolve_conflicts started with simpler approach
to conflict resolution.
