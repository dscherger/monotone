Replaces `automate content_diff` by a generic `automate diff` command
which outputs the complete changeset (including node adds, drops,
renames and attribute changes) in an generic basic\_io format. The
actual diff is included in a `data` stanza in unified diff format.

There hasn't yet been
an consensus if this should really be the "official" format mtn should
use to express external changesets - primarily because once this is
set into stone we certainly want an `automate apply_diff` command to
complement this functionality. We also still have to find a way to
express binary deltas within this new format to make it really useful
for the `apply_diff` use case.

Status: [[status/Stalled]] for quite a long time, as above
