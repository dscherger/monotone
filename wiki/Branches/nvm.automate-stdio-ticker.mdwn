Tries to implement a stdio ticker so automate clients can
actually monitor the progress of a netsync operation.

Status: Unusable, should probably be suspended and/or redone from
scratch (and maybe rethought even when / if [[Branches/nvm.nuskool]]
gets ready?)

Superseded by [[Branches/nvm.automate_out_of_band]] ?
