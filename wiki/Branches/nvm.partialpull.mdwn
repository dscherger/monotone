Connected to [[Branches/nvm.gaps]].

Both branches are about partial pulls, i.e. storing only revisions
newer than those of a certain horizon (including them). See
[[PartialPull]] for more information and a nice illustration. Both
branches introduce some form of a sentinel, which covers an inexistant
or incomplete revision. The difference for n.v.m.gaps is, that these
sentinels don't just cover all revisions from the covered one until
the root (null revision), but to any arbitrary revision, from which we
have the revision data again.
