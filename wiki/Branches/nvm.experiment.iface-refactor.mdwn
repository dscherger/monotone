Some experimental UI and doc tweaks, in attempt to make things more
streamlined and friendly to new users.

Current changes: `setup` is renamed to `new_project`.  `pull` and
`setup` have `--new-db` switches, avoiding the need to `db init` in
almost all cases.  Tempted to rename `genkey` too...

Todo: get feedback; update docs accordingly; write tests
