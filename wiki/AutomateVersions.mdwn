[[!tag migration-done]]

The rules to determine if the release version identifier X.Y is raised or not, are as follows:

 * the major number X increments whenever a backwards incompatible change is made
 * the minor number Y increments whenever any other change is made; it is reset to 0 when major number increments
 * either the major number X or the minor number Y increases at most once per release

###Legend

A = Addition, B = Backwards-compatible change, C = Backwards-incompatible change

###Notes

<sup>1</sup> While the format of several command has not been changed between 0.39 and 0.40, the output of the commands (f.e. `automate inventory`)  may differ because the interpretation of the --depth option changed in 0.40 (previously: 0 = the node + its immediate children, now: 0 = only this node)

If you like to get more information about certain command / format changes, please consult [[monotone's_Automation_documentation|docs/Automation.html]].
