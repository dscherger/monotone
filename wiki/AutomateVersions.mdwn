[[!tag migration-done]]

The rules to determine if the release version identifier X.Y is raised or not, are as follows:

 * the major number X increments whenever a backwards incompatible change is made
 * the minor number Y increments whenever any other change is made; it is reset to 0 when major number increments
 * either the major number X or the minor number Y increases at most once per release

###Notes

<sup>1</sup> While the format of several command has not been changed between
0.39 and 0.40, the output of the commands (f.e. `automate inventory`)  may differ
because the interpretation of the --depth option changed in 0.40 (previously:
0 = the node + its immediate children, now: 0 = only this node)

<sup>2</sup> After the options rework in 0.99 many automate commands gained
additional options which allow the negation of flags just like their non-automate
counterparts, which aren't all accounted here. Furthermore some more "exotic"
options are no longer part of the public API and have thus been hidden, like
`--min-netsync-version` and `--max-netsync-version`.

<sup>3</sup> Netsync automate commands accept just as their non-automate
counterparts the new URI syntax and issue a warning if the old calling syntax
(separate server and branch include / exclude pattern) is used.

If you like to get more information about certain command / format changes,
please consult [[monotone's_Automation_documentation|docs/Automation.html]].
