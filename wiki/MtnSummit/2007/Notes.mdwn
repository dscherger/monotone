# Done

 * ssh-agent support
   * support for passphrase-less keys (monotone internal and ssh_agent_export)
   * added check for valid signature right after signing data
 * detecting workspace collision (update/checkout/pluck/...)
 * asciik (for log)
 * annotate zoooooom
 * finish it translation
 * workspace merge (.nocornflakes)
 * po/ file fix
 * ChangeLog die-die-died
 * testsuite.lua giant list gone
 * cygwin tests pass now
 * line-ending/charset conversion stuff gone
 * Markus found another line-merging bug :-(
 * some workspace handling bugs
 * more CvsImport
 * checkout is using editable_tree now
 * some initial work on TortoiseMTN
 * new concept: locked workspace
 * learn our crypto all sucks
 * audit #include <iostream>'s
 * fix `ls unknown` in subdir regression
 * some charset fixes for `log` and friends
 * passphraseless monotone keys

# Decisions/plans

 * PartialPull
 * policy branches
 * ["LogUI"]
 * DatabaseCompaction
 * get rid of regular expressions in the UI
 * minimize dependencies on boost (esp., get rid of boost:re, boost::fs, boost::date_time)
 * fix stupid GFDL
 * the workspace collision-detection stuff really does need to go through roster_merge; update can bring in conflicts on attrs as well as filename.
 * `attach`/`detach`
 * cvssync: almost ready to merge automate improvements
 * need to reorder tests into classes
 * remove all regexen

# Todo today

 * review
   * annotate:
     * propagate from mainline
     * fix annotate for changed file in workspace
     * factor out some stuff in database.cc -- need some help
     * review: Nathaniel
   * asciik
     * review: Derek
   * ssh-agent
     * need tests
     * need review: Zack
 * any more planning/discussion now?
