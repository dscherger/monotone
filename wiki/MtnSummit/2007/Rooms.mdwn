We have until January 20 to book rooms at our special rate.  This page is to help us figure out roommates and such things.  Each room is booked for a particular amount of time, by a particular person -- this is the person that calls the hotel and uses their own credit card.  Other people probably want to stay with them too to split costs, but the hotel doesn't care about that (just the number staying in the room), so we have to arrange it separately...
