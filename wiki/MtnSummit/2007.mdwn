We are holding a sprint!  Or sprints.  Or something.  Anyway, we're getting as many of us together as we can, to hack like mad.  Would you like to come too?

Our bar is strict but low: if you're willing to work, you're welcome to come.  Even if you haven't worked with monotone source before, we'll help you get started -- or help with the docs, or testing... plenty of work for everyone.

See [[Ideas]] for brainstorming things to work on.
