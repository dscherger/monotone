Monotone developers try to get together regularly for a hackfest,
chatfest, bugfest, keysigningfest and occasional beerfest we call
the **MtnSummit**.

Our bar is strict but low: if you're willing to work, you're welcome
to come.  Even if you haven't worked with monotone source before,
we'll help you get started -- or help with the docs, or
testing... plenty of work for everyone.
