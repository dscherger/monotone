The problem is to find a way to share policy for a branch about what revisions will be accepted in a way that balances simplicity and predictability with flexibility and power.

As of right now at the Monotone summit, Graydon, Nathaniel and Paul are all working on this and have three distinct but overlapping sets of ideas on how to address it.

 * ["/Graydon"] for Graydon's current proposal
 * ["/Comparison"] for comparisons between proposals
 * ["/WorkList"] for work-in-progress during conference
 * ["/Interface"] for ideas about what the observable results should be

Largely old stuff:

 * ["/SPKIWontWork"]
 * ["/Archive"] for archived discussion
