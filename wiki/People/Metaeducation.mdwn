Hello there.  I was a programmer for a long time and have worked on
two "distributed version control systems" in the past.  I am
evaluating the monotone project and perhaps will be able to contribute
in interesting ways.

I would not have been able to get my head around the Monotone model
(at least not nearly as easily) if not for the patient+helpful people
on the #monotone IRC channel, with whose help I started
[[AlternativeOverview]] and [[Buidling_on_Mac|Building/Mac]].
