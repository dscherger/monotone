Hello there.  I was a programmer for a long time and have worked on two "distributed version control systems" in the past.  I am evaluating the monotone project and perhaps will be able to contribute in interesting ways.

I would not have been able to get my head around the Monotone model (at least not nearly as easily) if not for the patient+helpful people on the #monotone IRC channel, with whose help I started AlternativeOverview and BuildingOnMac.
