Improve the way workspace conflicts that occur during Update are
handled.

Previous approaches have involved interactive solutions (pop up an
external file merger), or adding conflicting files in the
workspace ([[ConflictFixupPolicy]], [[MergeViaWorkingDir]]), to be
cleaned up by the user later.

Here we propose a different approach, extending 'mtn conflicts' to
handle workspace conflicts.

The process is to first identify all conflicts in a proposed update,
and then provide a mechanism to specify resolutions for each of them.
After all resolutions are specified, the update can take place.
