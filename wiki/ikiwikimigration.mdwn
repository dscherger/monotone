# How to migrate pages to ikiwiki

1. fetch the page you're going to migrate, in raw original moinmoin
   markup style, into the workspace, and commit it as is for
   reference. (adjust as needed for some other tool, like wget or curl).

        ftp -o ZipperMerge.moin "http://www.venge.net/mtn-wiki/ZipperMerge?action=raw"
        mtn add ZipperMerge.moin
        mtn commit

2. rename the file and begin the process of migrating the markup

        mtn mv ZipperMerge.moin ZipperMerge.mdwn

   start by adding `\[[tag migration-wip]]` at the top of the file.
   This tags the page as one being worked on, but not yet finished.

3. Translate the markup:

    * headers are done with leading `#` `##` etc rather than
      surrounding `==` etc

    * *some* and **more** emphasis is done with `*` rather than lots
      of single-quotes

    * Links are done with `\[[SquareBrackets]]` rather than bare
      `CamelCaseWords` 

    * preformatted code blocks are done with 4 more spaces (inside the
      current level of indentation, say when inside nested lists),
      rather than with  `{{{` and `}}}`

    * use [[ikiwiki/formatting]] to help, and add more notes here

    * when migrating page markup, try to minimise the number of
      additional unrelated formatting changes (like reflowing
      paragraphs) in the same commit.
      That can be done as a separate step.

      When flowing paragraphs, try to follow the "new sentence, new
      line" convention.
      Ikiwiki uses a blank line to break paragraphs.
      This tends to mean that when someone else later adjusts a
      few words in a paragraph, we don't get many
      lines of sourounding diffs that are just reflowing.

4. Generate, test, rinse, repeat.  `commit` now and again if you like,
   because your page is still tagged as unfinished.

5. When you're happy, change to `\[[tag migration-done]]`, save and
   commit again.

6. `GOTO 1`
