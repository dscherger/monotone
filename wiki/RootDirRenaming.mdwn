The ability to change root dirs is needed for 0.26, so people with existing root dir sutures can migrate.

There is a branch for this: `net.venge.monotone.root-dir-rename`

The branch has:

  * rosters have the ability to change roots
  * roster\_merge handles the new conflict cases this allows

The branch needs:

  * an implementation of pivot\_root
    * NB: make sure to refuse to pivot\_root if the proposed new root has a subdir named "MT"
  * lots of tests
    * make the roster.cc test automaton generate root dir stuff
    * roster\_merge stuff
    * pivot\_root stuff
    * rosterify on db with root sutures
    * ?
