# Things in common between Paul's proposal and Graydon's

 * At the lowest level branches are identified by OIDs that don't have inherent semantics
 * You follow a "branch descriptor" to get to a branch.  The descriptor includes information about:
   * the OID of the branch
   * how to tell good revisions from bad (eg trusted keys)
 * "Policy branches" are versioned branches that contaiin branch descriptors
 * Policy branches don't have policy for themselves, only for other branches
   * Here, is "other branches" == sub branches? Or could net.foo.bar contain a policy for net.foo.baz? - JackLloyd
 * They can have policy for other policy branches and for "normal" branches.
 * Policy branches can provide names for what they refer to with branch descriptors
 * or they can defer everything that is referred to them to another policy branch wholesale
 * To start on a project, users import a top-level project policy branch descriptor
 * ...that they fetch out-of-band, probably by getting it out of the DNS
 * and they give it a name of their own choosing in their own namespace
 * though they'd be best advised to give it the most usual name if they can eg "monotone" for monotone :-)
