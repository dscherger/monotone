This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

Store Unix Symbolic Links as versionable objects in the repository, and recreate them on checkout/update.

# Partially Supported

Monotone ignores symlinks by default, but extensions to store these can be implemented using attrs and hooks. These are under active development and in use at the moment and may be integrated into a future release.

# Example Usage

See UnixAttribsAndSymlinks

# Further Reference
