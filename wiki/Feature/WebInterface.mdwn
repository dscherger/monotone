This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

A web-based interface should allow for easy browsing of sources, history, logs, diffs, etc.

# Supported

There are a number of InterfacesFrontendsAndTools that work with monotone, including several web-based ones.  Monotone's own sources can be browsed using [http://grahame.angrygoats.net/viewmtn.shtml ViewMTN], and there is also a [http://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/~moschny/TracMonotone/ Trac plugin] under development.

# Example Usage
