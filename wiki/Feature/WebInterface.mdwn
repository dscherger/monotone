This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

A web-based interface should allow for easy browsing of sources, history, logs, diffs, etc.

# Supported

There are a number of InterfacesFrontendsAndTools that work with monotone, including several web-based ones.  Monotone's own sources can be browsed using [ViewMTN](http://grahame.angrygoats.net/viewmtn.shtml), and there is also a [Trac plugin](http://www.ipd.uni-karlsruhe.de/~moschny/TracMonotone/) under development.

# Example Usage
 
 * [Recent monotone activity, via ViewMTN](http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/branch.psp?branch=net.venge.monotone)
 * [Current monotone HEAD revision](http://viewmtn.angrygoats.net/headofbranch.psp?branch=net.venge.monotone) 
 * [Trac-monotone demonstration](http://trac.h975245.serverkompetenz.net/)
 * [Recent monotone activity, via CIA](http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/monotone)
