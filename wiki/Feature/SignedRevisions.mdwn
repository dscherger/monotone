This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

Revisions and changes should be cryptographically signed to ensure historical integrity and detect accidental or malicious alteration.

# Supported

This is a primary and fundamental component of monotone. Revisions are identified by the SHA-1 hash of their ancestry+content, and additional metadata about these revisions is attached using signed certs. 

# Example Usage
