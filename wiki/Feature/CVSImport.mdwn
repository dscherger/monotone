This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

The ability to import past project history from CVS and make it available to future development (so that diff, log, and other operations work as expected.

# Partially Supported

monotone can import cvs history, including collecting together changes in multiple files into synthesised change sets. The `cvs_import` command provides this feature; this is just one of several ways of working with ["MonotoneAndCVS"].

The primary limitation is that CVS branches are presently not attached to the revisions they branched off from: each is an independent linear history.  Work is underway to resolve this limitation.  

# Example Usage

To import a full CVS history, you need a copy of the cvsroot `,v` files:
{{{
 $ mtn -d /some/path/project.mtn cvs_import -b org.project $CVSROOT/dir
}}}

This will create a branch called `org.project` with contents and history that you would get from `cvs co dir`. Any CVS branches in that history will be created with names like `org.project.cvs-branch-name`.
