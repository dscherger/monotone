This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

It should be possible to trigger build and test systems to react to commits.

# Supported

Monotone has extensive hook and trigger facilities using lua.  Monotone uses BuildBot for its own build-testing infrastructure, integration of other systems like Tinderbox should be quite simple.  Contributions of script snippets and configuration documents are welcome!

Monotone is designed from the start to be integrated with other tools, to support distributed workflow and project development processes. UsingCerts, in particular `testresult` certs, such QA tools can publish their results for each revision back to the distributed development community, who can then depend on these results when choosing suitable code to work with.
