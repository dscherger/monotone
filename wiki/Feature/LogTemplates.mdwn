This page is one of many describing EvaluationFeatures that may be useful when comparing monotone to other similar (and not-so-similar) VCS systems.

# Description

Commit log messages should start from a predefined template that prompts the developer to fill in certain information or follow certain conventions.

# Not Supported

This is not presently supported, but would be simple to add - just nobody has gotten around to doing it yet.   Like a number of other similar simple features and good ideas, this is one of the QuickieTasks that would be a great way for a new contributor to get used to the monotone code.

It is possible to test the commit message for compliance to rules (see FeatureLogReview), and it would also be possible to implement this using hooks.  One suggestion would be to use a hook on other commands (like update) to copy the template to `_MTN/log` if it is empty.
