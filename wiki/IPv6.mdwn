IPv6 is a bit tricky.

# Known problems

If a system does not have IPv6 support, then the default attempt to bind to all interfaces fails.

Binding to a host name may also fail.  Or this may be an artifact of testing.
 * Was solved in Version  0.27 (base revision: 341e4a18c594cec49896fa97bd4e74de7bee5827)

We need a way to test this stuff on old systems!  The current testsuite always binds to 127.0.0.1, which does not catch either of the above bugs.  However, having monotone open a public port during the test run is highly suboptimal...
