Implement --no- for all Boolean options (by an automatic mechanism,
not manually). Allow options specified on the command line to override
options specified in hooks or _MTN/options, or earlier in the command
line.

For example, given the options '--foo --no-foo --foo', '--foo' is used
for the command.

One motivation for this is to allow users to set their preferred
default options in a hook, and then easily override them as needed.
That makes it less significant what mtn sets as the default.

For example (taken from [bug 17878]
(https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=17878#options),
[monotone-devel](http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/monotone-devel/2010-05/msg00118.html)),
many commands (approve, disapprove, pull, merge, etc) take an option
"--update", that updates the current workspace. If you always want
this behavior, you can define the get_default_command_options(cmd)
hook in your monotonerc. However, you then have no way to disable that
behavior for a particular command; you can't specify --no-update.

There is --no-workspace, but that's not the exact negation of
--update; it has other effects (you need to specify the db and branch,
for example).

Another example: [monotone-devel]
(http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/monotone-devel/2010-05/msg00138.html)
'mtn add' is non-recursive by default but allows for --recursive. If
you put this in get_default_command_options(cmd), there is no way to
override it.
