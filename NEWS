        0.20 release.  features, ui improvements, performance
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - major changes in netsync UI: serve/sync/push/pull now take a
          list of globs; clients can request arbitrary sets of
          branches, not just predefined "collections".  write
          permissions are now granted on a per-db level (they were
          before anyway).
                - where you used to say, e.g., "monotone pull
                  net.venge.monotone", you should instead say
                  "monotone pull net.venge.monotone*".  This may
                  require shell-quoting.
                - 'get_netsync_write_permitted' hooks must be changed
                  to take only one argument, the 'identity'.
                  'get_netsync_{read,anonymous_read}_permitted' hooks
                  now take a branch argument instead of a collection,
                  and will be called for each branch that a client
                  requests.
                - 0.19 clients cannot talk to 0.20 servers, and vice-versa.
                - special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
        - other major changes:
                - cvs_import re-written; many bugs fixed.  now
                  supports tags.
        - many minor netsync changes:
                - netsync traffic is now cryptographically authenticated
                  against corruption and man-in-the-middle attacks.
                  special thanks to Ethan Blanton <elb@elitists.net>,
                  Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - new hooks that are called when server receives data:
                  note_netsync_*_received.  special thanks to Timothy
                  Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - ancestry graphs that pass outside the given branch
                  are now synchronized correctly.  special thanks to
                  Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - UI improvements:
                - 'log' options changed: --depth has become --last;
                  new options --no-merges, --diffs, --brief.
                - 'status' has new option --brief.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
                - 'serve' has new option --pid-file.  special thanks
                  to Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - all commands taking restrictions now take option
                  --depth, to limit recursion through subdirectories.
                  special thanks to Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - merge command all take --author, --date now.
                - 'checkout', 'update' take --revision, instead of
                  using positional arguments.  special thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'commit' takes new --message-file option.
        - new features:
                - new commands: "db kill_branch_locally", "db
                  kill_revision_locally", useful for correcting some
                  mistakes.  special thanks to Brian Campbell
                  <brian.p.campbell@dartmouth.edu>, Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - new file attribute 'manual_merge', to prevent invocation of
                  merger on binary files.  hook added to guess correct
                  value at 'add' time.  special thanks to Riccardo
                  Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
                - new 'earlier than', 'later than' selectors.  special
                  thanks to Riccardo Ghetta <birrachiara@tin.it>.
        - new automate commands:
                - 'stdio', for efficient use by
                  front-ends.  special thanks to Timothy Brownawell
                  <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
                - 'certs', for fetching certs on a revision in a
                  parseable (basic io-based) format.  special thanks
                  to Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - 'inventory' output changed incompatibly; should be
                  much more usable now, and stable.  special thanks to
                  Derek Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - better memory/performance when handling large files.
          special thanks to Eric Anderson
          <anderse-monotone@cello.hpl.hp.com>, Timothy Brownawell
          <tbrownaw@gmail.com>, Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
          Matthew Gregan <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
        - new text mode browser in contrib/mtbrowse.sh, by Henry
          Nestler <Henry@BigFoot.de>.
        - improved zsh completion in contrib/monotone.zsh_completion,
          by Joel Reed <joelwreed@comcast.com>.

                - upgrading from 0.19: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  netsync clients and servers need
                  to be upgraded together, as described above.  the
                  many ui changes may require script updates.

Tue May  3 00:31:37 PDT 2005

        0.19 release.  performance improvements, features, ui
        improvements, and bug fixes.

        - many operations sped up by another factor of 2 or better.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>.
                - first steps towards automated benchmarking.  Thanks
                  to Timothy Brownawell <tbrownaw@gmail.com>.
        - new major features:
                - "annotate" command; still requires optimization.
                  Thanks to Emile Snyder <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - "inodeprints" for fast change detection in large
                  working dirs now fully supported; see manual for
                  details.
        - new minor features:
                - new selector "c:name=value" for selecting on
                  arbitrary certs.  Thanks to Richard Levitte

                - new hooks to automatically initialize attributes on
                  add; monotone now automatically sets execute bit on
                  executables.  Thanks to Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.net>.
                - new automate command "select", to do selector
                  expansion.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - new automate commands "graph", "parents",
                  "children", "ancestors", to easily inspect history.
                  Special thanks to Sebastian Spaeth
                  <Sebastian@SSpaeth.de>.
                - new command "db kill_rev_locally".  Thanks to
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.

                  for patch attribution and importing history.
                - new automate command "inventory" (output format will
                  change in next release, however).  Thanks to Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>.
        - ui improvements:
                - netsync progress ticker in kilobytes/megabytes.
                  Thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au> and
                  Sebastian Spaeth <Sebastian@sspaeth.de>.
                - tickers do not cause annoying scrolling when wider
                  than window.  Special thanks to Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - warn users when a commit creates divergence, and
                  when an update ignores it.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - support for command-specific options (there is still
                  no rule that such options must appear after the
                  command on the command line, though).  Thanks to
                  Richard Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
        - bug fixes:
                - many cvs_import bugs fixed.  Special thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>, Emile Snyder

                  <hjlipp@web.de>, Matthew Gregan
                  <kinetik@orcon.net.nz>.
                - windows/unix working copy line ending conversion now
                  works correctly.  Thanks to Emile Snyder
                  <emile@alumni.reed.edu>.
                - many fixes to i18n-ized filename support
                - "drop" and "rename" now affect file attributes as
                  well.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org> and Joel Reed
                  <joelwreed@comcast.com>.
                - better error reporting in netsync.  Thanks to
                  Grahame Bowland <grahame@angrygoats.net>.
                - only set working directory's default branch on some
                  commands (update, commit).  Thanks to Florian Weimer
                  <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
                - "db check" now sets exit status correctly, for use
                  in scripts.  Thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - many others...
        - fantastic emacs integration in contrib/monotone.el.  Thanks
          to Harley Gorrell <harley@panix.com>.
        - 45 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~84%.

                - upgrading from 0.18: database and working copies are
                  fully compatible.  NOTE that the configuration file
                  is now ~/.monotone/monotonerc, rather than old
                  ~/.monotonerc.  Simply create ~/.monotone, and
                  rename any existing configuration file.

Sun Apr 10 17:49:25 PDT 2005

        0.18 release.  performance improvements, features, and bug fixes.
	This release is dedicated to Shweta Narayan.

        - most operations sped up by a factor of 2 or better; many sped up
	  by up several orders of magnitude.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Linus Torvalds
                  <torvalds@osdl.org>.
        - new concept: "database vars".  Used in several features below.
        - new features:
                - new file "MT/log" can be edited while you work,
                  sets default changelog.  (no change in behaviour if
                  you do not edit it.)  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - monotone now stores default netsync
                  server/collection, initialized on first use of
                  netsync.
                - you no longer need to manually import server
                  keys, monotone will fetch the key from the server on
                  first netsync.
                - monotone keeps track of keys of servers you have
                  previously synced with, to prevent man-in-the-middle
                  attacks.
                - several powerful new "automate" commands added.
		- new command 'ls known', lists files that are under version
		  control.  Thanks to Florian Weimer <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
		- preliminary "inodeprints" functionality -- speeds up diff,
		  status, etc.  No UI or documentation yet -- in a working
		  copy, 'touch MT/inodeprints' to enable, then commit or
		  update to populate cache.
        - UI improvements:
                - Added short options -r, -b, -k, -m.
                - default to 'dot' ticker-style when stderr is
                  not a tty, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - New "-@/--xargs" option, helpful when using new
                  automate commands.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - New "--depth" argument to 'log'.  Thanks to Richard
                  Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'db info' gives statistics on space usage.
                - new command 'dropkey'.  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
        - robustness improvement: if monotone crashes in a working
          directory and --dump and --debug were not specified, saves
          debug dump to "MT/debug" for analysis, instead of
          discarding.
        - new contributed scripts: CIA (cia.navi.cx) notification,
          email notification, Bash completion.
        - 33 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~82%.
        - many bug fixes
		- Special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
		  for going above and beyond to track down the last
		  release blocker.

                - upgrading from 0.17 requires only a 'db migrate'.

Fri Mar 18 15:38:52 PST 2005

        0.17 release. bug fixes and features.

        - many, many robustness improvements
                - more careful checking everywhere
                - much more thorough test suite
                - all revisions subject to careful checks before
                  entering database
                        - not yet fully optimized; "pull" may be very
                          slow and use lots of cpu
                - support for "epochs", to safely manage future
                  rebuilds, hash migration, etc.
                - new "db check" command, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3, thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>.
                - removes most former size limitations
        - "restrictions" support, thanks to Derek Scherger
          <derek@echologic.com>.
                - most commands now take a list of files to limit
                  their actions to
                - monotone can now be run from anywhere in the working
                  directory (not just the root)
                - new command "monotone setup" required to create a
                  working directory for a new project
        - important security fix -- don't use shell when calling
          external merge commands.
        - format change for "MT/options", ".mt-attrs"; you may have to
          edit these files
                - new command "attr" for managing .mt-attrs.
        - builds merkle tries in-memory -- netsync starts up many
          times faster
        - start of new "automate" interface, for shell scripts and
          others.
        - new command "cdiff": generates context diffs.
        - remove most of now-obsolete manifest/file cert support.
        - 60+ new integration tests.
        - many portability fixes
                - in particular, major win32 cleanups, thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>.  win32 is once again
                  fully and natively supported.
