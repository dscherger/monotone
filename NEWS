Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.70 (2010-05-23 14:50:00)
============================================================

New:
- Added support for connecting to networked Monotone servers, this also
  includes a bookmark and bookmark manager features.
- Added support for comparing any two arbitrary revisions in a database.
- Added a View menu that allows the user to select the character encoding in
  use inside text files stored inside a Monotone database rather than just
  assume it is UTF-8.

Changes:
- The revision comparison window now allows a user to stop the comparison not
  only during the formatting stage but also during the actual mtn diff
  operation as well.
- Improved some of the messages in error dialogs.
- Improved and corrected a few tooltips and removed some others that are
  dynamically generated by the application.
- Now a bit more explicit about the error handing from the character
  encode/decode routines. The character decoding is now handled more
  specifically for files.
- Updated the help documentation and the translation files in light of the
  changes made to mtn-browse.

Bugs Fixed:
- Worked around a bug in Gnome::VFS which causes a core dump on Debian Lenny.
- All menu items that rely on an open database are now disabled when there
  isn't one.
- Now guard against re-entrancy in custom dialog windows when calling the
  hide() method.
- Needless updates to the MIME types treeview are now avoided.
- Now track changes in paths inside the MIME treeview as a result of the user
  changing the display order.
- Sorted out the focus issue with all TreeViews when searching for text (the
  selection would change but nothing else acted on that selection change).
- Now deal with errors resulting from trying to open a Monotone database in a
  much more intelligent way.

Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.63 (2009-11-08 13:53:00)
============================================================

New:
- Contents differences are now done via the stdio i/f for Monotone version 0.45
  and upwards.
- Added the binary threshold preference option.
- Added a tooltip feedback feature for auto-completing comboboxentry widgets
  and associated preference options.
- Added a preference option for listing folders before files instead of
  alphabetically in directory listings.
- Made some of the button icons more meaningful and improved the look of some
  of the rest.
- Added the `Multiple Revisions' dialog window and use it when either a tag has
  been selected which is not unique on that branch or when auto select head
  revision is switched on and the user switches to a multi-headed branch.
- Implemented a mode where help is displayed using the desktop's web browser.
  Just in case yelp is not installed on the system (as is the case with Apple
  Mac OSX).
- The installers now cope with HTML stype help files. Also added the
  HTML_VIEWER/--help-viewer installation option and updated the dependencies.
- Added the FILE_COMPARISON installation option.

Changes:
- Moved the location of the Glade files to be more inline with standard Linux
  installation locations.
- Updated the help documentation in light of the changes made to the GUI.
- Re-ordered some preference settings into more logical groups.
- Updated the POT file.
- Locale update from Thomas Keller.

Bugs Fixed:
- History ordering is now consistent.
- Now guard against files comparing the same between different revisions.
- Autocompletion now does not allow "" as a valid complete entry against an
  empty list of possible completions.
- The autocompletion logic has been cleaned up some more so as not to make
  unnecesary updates to the screen and to correctly detect completions when
  deleting text from the end of a term and the static lists setting is turned
  on.
- Truncated completions are still marked as complete if the truncated value is
  so.
- The status bar is cleared out when opening another database.
- Now check that a program is known before attempting to run it. If it isn't
  known then tell the user via a dialog window.
- UTF-8 handling now works correctly.
- More robust process and interprocess handling.
- Set the page size attribute on all spin buttons to zero. This stops warning
  messages on Ubuntu.
- Corrected typos in the locale README file.

Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.62 (2009-05-03 18:00:00)
============================================================

New:
- Added the new relevant selectors introduced in Monotone 0.43.
- Implemented the help sub-system and wrote the manual. This not only supports
  displaying the help manual but also `help on window' and `context sensitive
  help' features.
- Added the home page help menu option.
- Added a user preference option for determining how a list search is done
  (either plain text or as a re).
- Added user preference options for controlling the look of the toolbar.
- Added Thomas Keller's German locale file for mtn-browse.

Changes:
- Implemented a caching class derived from Monotone::AutomateStdio for caching
  branch list information. Switched the rest of the application over to this
  new class.
- Now weed out unsupported selectors from the GUI depending upon the version of
  Monotone being used.
- Gtk2::FileChooserDialog dialog windows now have their current directory
  location saved between invocations.
- Enabled the use of the Find Text dialog window within the Advanced Find
  dialog window.
- References to MIME are now correctly in upper case.
- Corrected spelling of cronologically to chronologically.
- Reinstated the Gnome save window settings setting.
- Now display a file's author instead of file id in the main browser window.
- Renamed the `Separator' selector to `Logical And', it makes more sense.

Bugs Fixed:
- Added calls to the present() method after each call to show()/show_all() for
  each window (fixes the focus issue with windows not shown by default on
  desktops that use click to focus).
- Started using the update method on spinbuttons in order to make sure that
  their internal state is consistent.
- Corrected a few stack handling issues in the WindowManager class.
- mtn-browse now correctly gets the name of the database from a workspace
  regardless of the user's `auto_select' setting.
- When a single file is selected for comparison, the results window is now
  scrolled to that file.
- Fixed a bug whereby the external file comparison button remained enabled when
  a lone binary file was selected for comparison.


Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.61 (2009-02-08 18:00:00)
============================================================

New:
- Annotate window now offers a lot more options via its menu for accessing file
  and revision change logs and comparing between the current file or revision
  its parent version.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether line numbers are
  displayed by default when showing a file's contents.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether branch and revision
  comboboxentries update their lists when the user is typing in values (a
  performance tuning option).
- Implemented the option of selecting a search column in a treeview widget.
- Searching in a treeview now uses REs.
- Added installation via `perl Makefile.PL'.

Changes:
- Vertical panes now maintain the size of the left hand window.
- A scroll margin is now used when finding text. This makes it easier to see
  the context of a found string when it is at the top or bottom of the window.
- Beefed up linux-install, now called linux-installer. It now:
  - Can take all its information from the command line.
  - Supports the concept of DESTDIR.
  - Checks that Perl dependencies have been met.
  - Has built in help.
- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
- README file has been updated as a result of the changes in linux-installer.

Bugs Fixed:
- Now a little bit better at reporting helper application launch errors to the
  user.
- Annotate no longer fails on an empty file.
- Annotate and comparisons are no longer affected by where the application is
  run inside a workspace.
- mtn-browse now always explicitly opens a database rather than relying on the
  mtn subprocess sorting itself out inside a workspace. This is much safer.
- Database locked dialog windows are no longer parented.
- Now guard against no external comparison helper application being setup.
- Directory separators are no longer assumed to be '/'.
- The get_revision_ids routine now correctly uses the current branch to refine
  the query (can now cope with multiple tags on different branches).
