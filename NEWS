Overview Of Changes In mtn-browse 0.61 (2009-02-08 18:00:00)
============================================================

New:
- Annotate window now offers a lot more options via its menu for accessing file
  and revision change logs and comparing between the current file or revision
  its parent version.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether line numbers are
  displayed by default when showing a file's contents.
- Added a user preference option for controlling whether branch and revision
  comboboxentries update their lists when the user is typing in values (a
  performance tuning option).
- Implemented the option of selecting a search column in a treeview widget.
- Searching in a treeview now uses REs.
- Added installation via `perl Makefile.PL'.

Changes:
- Vertical panes now maintain the size of the left hand window.
- A scroll margin is now used when finding text. This makes it easier to see
  the context of a found string when it is at the top or bottom of the window.
- Beefed up linux-install, now called linux-installer. It now:
  - Can take all its information from the command line.
  - Supports the concept of DESTDIR.
  - Checks that Perl dependencies have been met.
  - Has built in help.
- Switched all Perl scripts over to demanding Perl 5.8.5.
- README file has been updated as a result of the changes in linux-installer.

Bugs Fixed:
- Now a little bit better at reporting helper application launch errors to the
  user.
- Annotate no longer fails on an empty file.
- Annotate and comparisons are no longer affected by where the application is
  run inside a workspace.
- mtn-browse now always explicitly opens a database rather than relying on the
  mtn subprocess sorting itself out inside a workspace. This is much safer.
- Database locked dialog windows are no longer parented.
- Now guard against no external comparison helper application being setup.
- Directory separators are no longer assumed to be '/'.
- The get_revision_ids routine now correctly uses the current branch to refine
  the query (can now cope with multiple tags on different branches).
