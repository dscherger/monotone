        0.18 release.  performance improvements, features, and bug fixes.
	This release is dedicated to Shweta Narayan.

        - most operations sped up by a factor of 2 or better; many sped up
	  by up several orders of magnitude.
                - special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>, Derek
                  Scherger <derek@echologic.com>, Linus Torvalds
                  <torvalds@osdl.org>.
        - new concept: "database vars".  Used in several features below.
        - new features:
                - new file "MT/log" can be edited while you work,
                  sets default changelog.  (no change in behaviour if
                  you do not edit it.)  Thanks to Jeremy Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
                - monotone now stores default netsync
                  server/collection, initialized on first use of
                  netsync.
                - you no longer need to manually import server
                  keys, monotone will fetch the key from the server on
                  first netsync.
                - monotone keeps track of keys of servers you have
                  previously synced with, to prevent man-in-the-middle
                  attacks.
                - several powerful new "automate" commands added.
		- new command 'ls known', lists files that are under version
		  control.  Thanks to Florian Weimer <fw@deneb.enyo.de>.
		- preliminary "inodeprints" functionality -- speeds up diff,
		  status, etc.  No UI or documentation yet -- in a working
		  copy, 'touch MT/inodeprints' to enable, then commit or
		  update to populate cache.
        - UI improvements:
                - Added short options -r, -b, -k, -m.
                - default to 'dot' ticker-style when stderr is
                  not a tty, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
                - New "-@/--xargs" option, helpful when using new
                  automate commands.  Thanks to Richard Levitte
                  <richard@levitte.org>.
                - New "--depth" argument to 'log'.  Thanks to Richard
                  Levitte <richard@levitte.org>.
                - 'db info' gives statistics on space usage.
                - new command 'dropkey'.  Thanks to Jeremey Cowgar
                  <jeremy@cowgar.com>.
        - robustness improvement: if monotone crashes in a working
          directory and --dump and --debug were not specified, saves
          debug dump to "MT/debug" for analysis, instead of
          discarding.
        - new contributed scripts: CIA (cia.navi.cx) notification,
          email notification, Bash completion.
        - 33 new integration tests.  total line coverage: ~82%.
        - many bug fixes
		- Special thanks to Matt Johnston <matt@ucc.asn.au>,
		  for going above and beyond to track down the last
		  release blocker.

                - upgrading from 0.17 requires only a 'db migrate'.

Fri Mar 18 15:38:52 PST 2005

        0.17 release. bug fixes and features.

        - many, many robustness improvements
                - more careful checking everywhere
                - much more thorough test suite
                - all revisions subject to careful checks before
                  entering database
                        - not yet fully optimized; "pull" may be very
                          slow and use lots of cpu
                - support for "epochs", to safely manage future
                  rebuilds, hash migration, etc.
                - new "db check" command, thanks to Derek Scherger
                  <derek@echologic.com>.
        - now uses sqlite3, thanks to Christof Petig
          <christof@petig-baender.de>.
                - removes most former size limitations
        - "restrictions" support, thanks to Derek Scherger
          <derek@echologic.com>.
                - most commands now take a list of files to limit
                  their actions to
                - monotone can now be run from anywhere in the working
                  directory (not just the root)
                - new command "monotone setup" required to create a
                  working directory for a new project
        - important security fix -- don't use shell when calling
          external merge commands.
        - format change for "MT/options", ".mt-attrs"; you may have to
          edit these files
                - new command "attr" for managing .mt-attrs.
        - builds merkle tries in-memory -- netsync starts up many
          times faster
        - start of new "automate" interface, for shell scripts and
          others.
        - new command "cdiff": generates context diffs.
        - remove most of now-obsolete manifest/file cert support.
        - 60+ new integration tests.
        - many portability fixes
                - in particular, major win32 cleanups, thanks to Jon
                  Bright <jon@siliconcircus.com>.  win32 is once again
                  fully and natively supported.
        - many bug fixes

                - several incompatible changes: see file UPGRADE for
                  migration information

	NOTE: this release expands the sqlite page size. YOU WILL NEED
	to dump existing databases before upgrading and reload it
	after upgrading, otherwise monotone will complain that the
	database image appears malformed. this condition cannot
	unfortunately be distinguished from a real malformed image on
	disk. for example:

		$ monotone --db=my.db db dump >dump.sql
		$ <upgrade to new monotone>
		$ mv my.db my.db.backup
		$ monotone --db=my.db db load <dump.sql

	- fixed bugs:
		- aliasing bug on debian (-O2 now works)

		- sha1 whitespace bug
		- netsync broken formatter
		- broken symlink handling
		- merger execution pessimism	
		- LCA bitset calculation pessimism
		- static object initialization order

		- CVS branch inference and topology
	- cryptographic SSE2 paths enabled on linux/x86. 
	- builds against boost 1.31.0. 
	- removed boost::socket
	- removed documentation about old networking system. 
	- "officially" deprecated old networking system. 
	- enable building with system-local libraries.
	- upgraded bundled sqlite. 
	- changed sqlite page size from 1k -> 8k

	documentation.
