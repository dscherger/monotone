1. Building mtsh

mtsh uses gtkmm-2.4 and the lexical_cast header from Boost, so you need the
dev versions of these two libraries. You also need a system that supports
fork()/pipe()/exec() .

To build, run
   ./bootstrap
   ./configure
   make


2. Usage

Run mtsh from a monotone working copy, or use the "Set working dir" button
to go to one. You can also use "Set database" if you don't have a working
copy -- in this case, you can only examine stored revisions and add file
comments to them. When viewing a working copy, you can add, drop, rename,
and revert files through a context menu on the file list.
