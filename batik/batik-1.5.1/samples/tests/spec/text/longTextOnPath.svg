The purpose of this test is to ensure that text-selection can keep up even when relatively large numbers of characters are part of the selection. Since I haven't reached the end yet, let me keep going with more really quite useless text just to see if we hit a limit where it really starts to slow things down.  However if it hasn't slowed down by now I'm guessing that it won't slow down at all.  But you never know for sure until you try it, so I am, and here is the result.  Selection does bog down a little near the end but it's redraw related.</textPath>
