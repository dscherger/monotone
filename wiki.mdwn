[[!toc ]]

This is a temporary wiki front page, for the [[ikiwiki_migration]] of 
the monotone wiki. It helps track progress.  Whether or not there will
be a 'normal' wiki homepage later (as separate from the main front
page) will be determined later.

For initial format conversion, a set of tags has been added to help
sort pages according to their state. These tags mostly refer to basic
markup conversion - just getting the markup and formatting styles
fixed for the new syntax. While the overall conversion may also
involve a lot of other work and cleanup (renaming, restucturing,
automating, etc) that's not the (primary) purpose of these tags.


## Pages tagged as migration-wip

[[!map pages="wiki/* and link(migration-wip)"]]

## Pages tagged as migration-auto

[[map pages="wiki/* and link(migration-auto)"]]

## Pages tagged as migration-done

[[!map pages="wiki/* and link(migration-done)"]]

## Other pages

[[!map pages="wiki/* and !link(migration-done) and !link(migration-auto) and !link(migration-wip) and !wiki/*.moin"]]

## Broken links

The following may indicate pages still needing to be migrated, 
or links needing adjustment after some renaming or other changes.
