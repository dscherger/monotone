<h2 class="chapter">2 Tutorial</h2>

<p>This chapter illustrates the basic uses of monotone by means of an
example, fictional software project.

<h3 class="section">2.1 Issues</h3>

<p>Before we walk through the tutorial, there are two minor issues to
address: standard options and revision selectors.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.1 Standard Options</h4>

<p>Before operating monotone, two important command-line options should
be explained.

     <ul>
<li>Most commands operate on a <i>database</i>, which is selected with
the <samp><span class="option">--db</span></samp> option. 
<li>Many commands operate on a subset of the database, called a
<i>branch</i>, which is selected with the <samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp> option. 
</ul>

   <p>Monotone will cache the settings for these options in your workspace, so
ordinarily once you have checked out a project, you will not need to
specify them again.  We will therefore only mention these arguments in
the first example.

<h4 class="subsection">2.1.2 Revision Selectors</h4>

<p>Many commands require you to supply 40-character <span class="sc">sha1</span> values as
arguments, which identify revisions. These &ldquo;revision IDs&rdquo; are
tedious to type, so monotone permits you to supply &ldquo;revision
selectors&rdquo; rather than complete revision IDs. Selectors are a more
&ldquo;human friendly&rdquo; way of specifying revisions by combining certificate
values into unique identifiers. This &ldquo;selector&rdquo; mechanism can be
used anywhere a revision ID would normally be used. For details on
selector syntax, see <a href="Selectors.html#Selectors">Selectors</a>.

   <p>We are now ready to explore our fictional project.

<h3 class="section">2.2 The Fictional Project</h3>

<p>Our fictional project involves 3 programmers cooperating to write
firmware for a robot, the JuiceBot 7, which dispenses fruit juice. The
programmers are named Jim, Abe and Beth.

     <ul>
<li>Jim lives in Japan, and owns JuiceBot Inc. You will know when we're talking
about Jim, because everything he does involves the letter &ldquo;j&rdquo;. 
<li>Abe lives in Australia and writes code related to apple juice. You will
know when we're talking about Abe, because everything he does involves
the letter &ldquo;a&rdquo;. 
<li>Beth lives in Brazil and writes code related to banana juice. You will
know when we're talking about Beth, because everything she does involves
the letter &ldquo;b&rdquo;. 
</ul>

   <p>In our example the programmers work privately on laptops, and are
usually <em>disconnected</em> from the network. They share no storage
system. Thus when each programmer enters a command, it affects only
his or her own computer, unless otherwise stated.

   <p>In the following, our fictional project team will work through several
version control tasks. Some tasks must be done by each member of our
example team; other tasks involve only one member.
