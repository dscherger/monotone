<h3 class="section">2.12 Branching and Merging</h3>

<p>So by now you're familiar with making changes, sharing them with other
people, and integrating your changes with their changes.  Sometimes,
though, you may want to make some changes, and <em>not</em> integrate them
with other people's &mdash; or at least not right away.  One way to do this
would be to simply never run <samp><span class="command">mtn merge</span></samp>; but it would
quickly become confusing to try and keep track of which changes were in
which revisions.  This is where <em>branches</em> are useful.

   <p>Continuing our example, suppose that Jim is so impressed by Beth's work
on banana juice support that he assigns her to work on the JuiceBot 7's
surprise new feature: muffins.  In the mean time, Abe will continue
working on the JuiceBot's basic juice-related functions.

   <p>The changes required to support muffins are somewhat complicated, and
Beth is worried that her work might destabilize the program, and
interfere with Abe's work.  In fact, she isn't even sure her first
attempt will turn out to be the right approach; she might work on it for
a while and then decide it was a bad idea, and should be discarded.  For
all these reasons, she decides that she will work on a branch, and then
once she is satisfied with the new code, she will merge back onto the
mainline.

   <p>She decides that since main development is in branch
<code>jp.co.juicebot.jb7</code>, she will use branch
<code>jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins</code>.  So, she makes the first few edits to
the new muffins code, and commits it on a new branch by simply passing
<samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp> to commit:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ mtn commit --branch=jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins --message='autobake framework'
     mtn: beginning commit on branch 'jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins'
     mtn: committed revision d33caefd61823ecbb605c39ffb84705dec449857
</pre>
   <p>That's all there is to it &mdash; there is now a
<code>jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins</code> branch, with her initial checkin on
it.  She can make further checkins from the same workspace, and they
will automatically go to the muffins branch; if anyone else wants to
help her work on muffins, they can check out that branch as usual.

   <p>Of course, while Beth is working on the new muffins code, Abe is still
making fixes to the main line.  Occasionally, Beth wants to integrate
his latest work into the muffins branch, so that her version doesn't
fall too far behind.  She does this by using the <samp><span class="command">propagate</span></samp>
command:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ mtn propagate jp.co.juicebot.jb7 jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins
     mtn: propagating jp.co.juicebot.jb7 -&gt; jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins
     mtn: [source] da003f115752ac6e4750b89aaca9dbba178ac80c
     mtn: [target] d0e5c93bb61e5fd25a0dadf41426f209b73f40af
     mtn: common ancestor 853b8c7ac5689181d4b958504adfb5d07fd959ab jim@juicebot.co.jp 2004-10-26T:12:44:23 found
     mtn: trying 3-way merge
     mtn: [merged] 89585b3c5e51a5a75f5d1a05dda859c5b7dde52f
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="command">propagate</span></samp> merges all of the new changes on one branch onto
another.

   <p>When the muffins code is eventually stable and ready to be integrated
into the main line of development, she simply propagates the other way:

<pre class="smallexample">     $ mtn propagate jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins jp.co.juicebot.jb7
     mtn: propagating jp.co.juicebot.jb7.muffins -&gt; jp.co.juicebot.jb7
     mtn: [source] 4e48e2c9a3d2ca8a708cb0cc545700544efb5021
     mtn: [target] bd29b2bfd07644ab370f50e0d68f26dcfd3bb4af
     mtn: common ancestor 652b1035343281a0d2a5de79919f9a31a30c9028 jim@juicebot.co.jp 2004-10-26T:15:25:05 found
     mtn: [merged] 03f7495b51cc70b76872ed019d19dee1b73e89b6
</pre>
   <p>Monotone always records the full history of all merges, and is designed
to handle an arbitrarily complicated graph of changes.  You can make a
branch, then branch off from that branch, propagate changes between
arbitrary branches, and so on; monotone will track all of it, and do
something sensible for each merge.  Of course, it is still probably a
good idea to come up with some organization of branches and a plan for
which should be merged to which other ones.  Monotone may keep track of
graphs of arbitrary complexity &mdash; but you will have more trouble. 
Whatever arrangement of branches you come up with, though, monotone
should be able to handle it.
