<h3 class="section">1.4 Certificates</h3>

<p>Often, you will wish to make a <i>statement</i> about a revision, such as
stating the reason that you made some changes, or stating the time at
which you made the changes, or stating that the revision passes a test
suite. Statements such as these can be thought of, generally, as a
bundle of information with three parts:

     <ul>
<li>an <i>ID</i>, indicating which revision you are making a statement about
<li>a <i>name</i> indicating the type of statement you are making, such as
&ldquo;changelog&rdquo;, &ldquo;date&rdquo; or &ldquo;testresult&rdquo;
<li>a <i>value</i> indicating the remaining detail of the statement, such as
&ldquo;fixed a bug&rdquo;, &ldquo;March 9th&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo;
</ul>

   <p>For example, if you want to say that a particular revision was
composed on April 4, 2003, you might make a statement like this:

   <div class="block-image"><img src="figures/statement.png" alt="figures/statement.png"></div>

   <p>In an ideal world, these are all the parts of a statement we would
need in order to go about our work. In the real world, however, there
are sometimes malicious people who would make false or misleading
statements; so we need a way to verify that a particular person made a
particular statement about a revision. We therefore will add two more
pieces of information to our bundle:

     <ul>
<li>a <i>key</i> which identifies the person making a statement
<li>a <i>signature</i> &mdash; just a large number with particular properties &mdash;
certifying the fact that the person made the statement
</ul>

   <p>When these 2 items accompany a statement, we call the total bundle of
5 items a <dfn>certificate</dfn>, or <i>cert</i>. A cert makes a statement in
a secure fashion. The security of the signature in a cert is derived
from the <span class="sc">rsa</span> cryptography system, the details of which are beyond
the scope of this document.

   <div class="block-image"><img src="figures/cert.png" alt="figures/cert.png"></div>

   <p><b>Warning:</b> because our certificates give the <i>name</i> of the
signing key instead of the <i>hash</i> (ID), all key names must be
globally unique forever. If you lose a key and need to generate a
replacement, make sure that you give the replacement a different name.

   <p>Monotone uses certs extensively. Any &ldquo;extra&rdquo; information which needs
to be stored, transmitted or retrieved &mdash; above and beyond files,
manifests, and revisions &mdash; is kept in the form of certs. This
includes change logs, time and date records, branch membership,
authorship, test results, and more. When monotone makes a decision
about storing, transmitting, or extracting files, manifests, or
revisions, the decision is often based on certs it has seen, and the
trustworthiness you assign to those certs.

   <p>The <span class="sc">rsa</span> cryptography system &mdash; and therefore monotone itself &mdash;
requires that you exchange special &ldquo;public&rdquo; numbers with your
friends, before they will trust certificates signed by you. These
numbers are called <dfn>public keys</dfn>. Giving someone your public key
does not give them the power to <i>impersonate</i> you, only to verify
signatures made by you. Exchanging public keys should be done over a
trusted medium, in person, or via a trusted third party. Advanced
secure key exchange techniques are beyond the scope of this document.
