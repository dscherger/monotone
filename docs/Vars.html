<h3 class="section">3.9 Vars</h3>

<p>Every monotone database has a set of <em>vars</em> associated with it. 
Vars are simple configuration variables that monotone refers to in some
circumstances; they are used for configuration that monotone needs to be
able to modify itself, and that should be per-database (rather than
per-user or per-workspace, both of which are supported by
<samp><span class="file">monotonerc</span></samp> scripts).  Vars are local to a database, and never
transferred by netsync.

   <p>A var is a <em>name</em> = <em>value</em> pairing inside a <em>domain</em>. 
Domains define what the vars inside it are used for; for instance, one
domain might contain database-global settings, and particular vars
inside it would define things like that database's default netsync
server.  Another domain might contain key fingerprints for servers that
monotone has interacted with in the past, to detect man-in-the-middle
attacks; the vars inside this domain would map server names to their
fingerprints.

   <p>You can set vars with the <samp><span class="command">set</span></samp> command, delete them with the
<samp><span class="command">unset</span></samp> command, and see them with the <samp><span class="command">ls vars</span></samp>
command.  See the documentation for these specific commands for more
details.

<h3 class="heading">Existing vars</h3>

<p>There are several pre-defined domains that monotone knows about:

     <dl>
<dt><code>database</code><dd>Contains database-global configuration information.  Defined names are:
          <dl>
<dt><code>default-exclude-pattern</code><dd>The default branch exclusion glob pattern for netsync operations to
use. Automatically set by first use of netsync, and by any netsync
that uses the <samp><span class="option">--set-default</span></samp> option. 
<br><dt><code>default-include-pattern</code><dd>The default branch glob pattern for netsync operations to use. 
Automatically set by first use of netsync, and by any netsync that
uses the <samp><span class="option">--set-default</span></samp> option. 
<br><dt><code>default-server</code><dd>The default server for netsync operations to use.  Automatically set
by first use of netsync, and by any netsync that uses the
<samp><span class="option">--set-default</span></samp> option. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>known-servers</code><dd>Contains key hashes for servers that we have netsynced with in the
past.  Analogous to <samp><span class="command">ssh</span></samp>'s <samp><span class="file">known_hosts</span></samp> file, this is
needed to detect man-in-the-middle attacks.  Automatically set the first
time you netsync with any given server.  If that server's key later
changes, monotone will notice, and refuse to connect until you have run
<samp><span class="command">mtn unset known-servers </span><var>server-name</var></samp>.

   </dl>
