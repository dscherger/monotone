<h3 class="section">3.3 Restrictions</h3>

<p>Several monotone commands accept optional <var>pathname...</var> arguments in
order to establish a &ldquo;restriction&rdquo;.  Restrictions are used to limit
the files and directories these commands examine for changes when
comparing the workspace to the revision it is based on. Restricting a
command to a specified set of files or directories simply ignores
changes to files or directories not included by the restriction.

   <p>The following commands all support restrictions using optional
<var>pathname...</var> arguments:

     <ul>
<li><samp><span class="command">status</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">revert</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">list known</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">list unknown</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">list ignored</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">list missing</span></samp>
<li><samp><span class="command">list changed</span></samp>
</ul>

   <p>Including either the old or new name of a renamed file or directory will
cause both names to be included in a restriction. If in doubt, the
<samp><span class="command">status</span></samp> command can be used to &ldquo;test&rdquo; a set of pathnames to
ensure that the expected files are included or excluded by a
restriction.

   <p>Commands which support restrictions also support the
<samp><span class="option">--depth=</span><var>n</var> </samp> option, where <var>n</var> specifies the maximum
number of directories to descend. For example, <var>n</var>=0 disables
recursion, <var>n</var>=1 means descend at most one directory, and so on.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">update</span></samp> command does not allow for updates to a
restricted set of files, which may be slightly different than other
version control systems. Partial updates don't really make sense in
monotone, as they would leave the workspace based on a revision that
doesn't exist in the database, starting an entirely new line of
development.

<h3 class="heading">Subdirectory restrictions</h3>

<p>The restrictions facility also allows commands to operate from within a
subdirectory of the workspace.  By default, the <i>entire workspace</i> is
always examined for changes. However, specifying an explicit "." 
pathname to a command will restrict it to the current subdirectory. 
Note that this is quite different from other version control systems and
may seem somewhat surprising.

   <p>The expectation is that requiring a single "." to restrict to the
current subdirectory should be simple to use. While the alternative,
defaulting to restricting to the current subdirectory, would require a
somewhat complicated ../../.. sequence to remove the restriction and
operate on the whole tree.

   <p>This default was chosen because monotone versions whole project trees
and generally expects to commit all changes in the workspace as a
single atomic unit. Other version control systems often version
individual files or directories and may not support atomic commits at
all.

   <p>When working from within a subdirectory of the workspace all
paths specified to monotone commands must be relative to the current
subdirectory.

<h3 class="heading">Finding a workspace</h3>

<p>Monotone only stores a single <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory at the root of a
workspace. Because of this, a search is done to find the <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp>
directory in case a command is executed from within a subdirectory of a
workspace. Before a command is executed, the search for a workspace
directory is done by traversing parent directories until an
<samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory is found or the filesystem root is reached. Upon
finding an <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory, the <samp><span class="file">_MTN/options</span></samp> file is read for
default options. The <samp><span class="option">--root</span></samp> option may be used to stop the
search early, before reaching the root of the physical filesystem.

   <p>Many monotone commands don't require a workspace and will simply
proceed with no default options if no <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory is found. 
However, some monotone commands do require a workspace and will fail
if no <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory can be found.

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">checkout</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">clone</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">setup</span></samp> commands
create a <i>new workspace</i> and initialize a new <samp><span class="file">_MTN/options</span></samp>
file based on their current option settings.
