by creating and populating the <samp><span class="file">_MTN</span></samp> directory with basic
information.  This information must include at least the branch and the
database to be used, both of which will be placed in the
<samp><span class="file">_MTN/options</span></samp> file.

     <p>This can be used with an empty directory to start a new blank project,
or within an existing directory full of files, prior to using
<samp><span class="command">mtn commit</span></samp>. If no directory is specified, the current
directory is used.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn add </span><var>pathname...</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-add-_0040var_007bpathname_002e_002e_002e_007d-16"></a><br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn add --unknown</span></samp><a name="index-mtn-add-_002d_002dunknown-17"></a><dd>This command places &ldquo;add&rdquo; entries for the paths specified in
<var>pathname...</var> in the workspace's &ldquo;work list&rdquo;. The work list of
your workspace is stored in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp>, and is a list of
explicit pathname changes you wish to commit at some future time, such
as addition, removal or renaming of files.

     <p>As a convenience, the <samp><span class="option">--unknown</span></samp> option can be used; this
option will cause all of the files listed by <samp><span class="command">mtn list
unknown</span></samp> to be added.

     <p>While this command places an &ldquo;add&rdquo; entry on your work list, it does
not immediately affect your database. When you <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> your
workspace, monotone will use the work list to build a new revision,
which it will then commit to the database. The new revision will have
any added entries inserted in its manifest.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn [--no-respect-ignore] mkdir </span><var>directory...</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-_005b_002d_002dno_002drespect_002dignore_005d-mkdir-_0040var_007bdirectory_002e_002e_002e_007d-18"></a><dd>This command creates a directory in the filesystem relative to your
current location and adds it to your workspace's &ldquo;work list&rdquo;.  The
changes are not reflected in your database until such time as you
perform a commit.  If you use the <samp><span class="option">--no-respect-ignore</span></samp> flag,
entries in .mtn-ignore will not be honoured.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn [--execute] drop </span><var>pathname...</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-_005b_002d_002dexecute_005d-drop-_0040var_007bpathname_002e_002e_002e_007d-19"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn drop --missing</span></samp><a name="index-mtn-drop-_002d_002dmissing-20"></a><dd>This command places &ldquo;drop&rdquo; entries for the paths specified in
<var>pathname...</var> in the workspace's &ldquo;work list&rdquo;. The work list of
your workspace is stored in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp>, and is a list of
explicit pathname changes you wish to commit at some future time, such
as addition, removal, or renaming of files.  This command also removes
any attributes on <var>pathname</var>; see <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a> for more
details.  If you use the <samp><span class="option">--missing</span></samp> flag it will add drop
entries for any paths that monotone is tracking for which you have
already removed the files from the filesystem, in addition to all those
specified in <var>pathname...</var>.

     <p>While this command places a &ldquo;drop&rdquo; entry on your work list, it does
not immediately affect your database. When you <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> your
workspace, monotone will use the work list to build a new revision,
which it will then commit to the database. The new revision will have
any dropped entries removed from its manifest.

     <p>Currently this command does <em>not</em> actually delete the file
<var>src</var> in your filesystem; if you want to actually delete the file,
you should run <samp><span class="command">drop</span></samp>, and then perform the actual delete using
whatever mechanism you normally use to delete files.

     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">--execute</span></samp> will make &ldquo;drop&rdquo; perform the actual
deletion operations in the filesystem.  It will ignore files or
directories which have already been deleted.

<var>src</var> and <var>dst</var> in the workspace's &ldquo;work list&rdquo;. The second form
renames a number of source paths to the given destination. The work
list of your workspace is stored in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp>, and is a list of
explicit pathname changes you wish to commit at some future time, such
as addition, removal, or renaming of files.  This command also moves any
attributes on <var>src</var> to <var>dst</var>; see <a href="File-Attributes.html#File-Attributes">File Attributes</a> for more
details.

     <p>While this command places a &ldquo;rename&rdquo; entry on your work list, it
does not immediately affect your database. When you <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp>
your workspace, monotone will use the work list to build a new
revision, which it will then commit to the database. The new revision
will have any renamed entries in its manifest adjusted to their new
names.

     <p>The option <samp><span class="option">--execute</span></samp> will make &ldquo;rename&rdquo; perform the actual
rename operations in the filesystem. It will ignore missing source files
and will not overwrite existing destination files.

This command looks at your workspace, decides which files have
changed, and saves the changes to your database. It does this by
loading the revision named in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp>, locating the base
manifest for your workspace, applying any pathname changes described
in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp>, and then comparing the updated base manifest
to the files it finds in your workspace, to determine which files have
been edited.

     <p>For each edited file, a delta is copied into the database. Then the
newly constructed manifest is recorded (as a delta) and finally the
new revision.  Once all these objects are recorded in you database,
<samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> updates <samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp> to indicate that the base
revision is now the newly created revision, and that there are no
pathname changes to apply.

     <p>Specifying pathnames to <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> restricts the set of changes
that are visible and results in only a partial commit of the workspace. 
Changes to files not included in the specified set of pathnames will be
ignored and will remain in the workspace until they are included in a
future commit. With a partial commit, only the relevant entries in
<samp><span class="file">_MTN/revision</span></samp> will be removed and other entries will remain for
future commits.

     <p>From within a subdirectory of the workspace the <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> command
will, by default, include <em>all changes</em> in the workspace. 
Specifying only the pathname "." will restrict <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> to files
changed within the current subdirectory of the workspace.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">--message</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--message-file</span></samp> options are mutually
exclusive.  Both provide a <var>logmsg</var> describing the commit. 
<samp><span class="option">--message-file</span></samp> actually specifies the name of the file containing
the log message, while <samp><span class="option">--message</span></samp> provides it directly.

     <p>Multiple <samp><span class="option">--message</span></samp> options may be provided on the command line. 
The log message will be formed by concatenating the <samp><span class="option">--message</span></samp>
options provided, with each one starting at the beginning of a new line.

     <p>The <samp><span class="file">_MTN/log</span></samp> file can be edited by the user during their daily
work to record the changes made to the workspace. When running the
<samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> command without a <var>logmsg</var> supplied, the contents of
the <samp><span class="file">_MTN/log</span></samp> file will be read and passed to the Lua hook
<code>edit_comment</code> as a second parameter named <var>user_log_content</var>. 
The log message will be prepended with a 'magic' string that must be
removed to confirm the commit.  This allows the user to easily cancel a
commit, without emptying the entire log message.  If the commit is
successful, the <samp><span class="file">_MTN/log</span></samp> file is cleared of all content making it
ready for another edit/commit cycle.

     <p>If a <samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp> option is specified, the <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> command
commits to this branch (creating it if necessary).  The branch becomes
the new default branch of the workspace.

     <p>The <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> command also synthesizes a number of
certificates, which it attaches to the new manifest version and copies
into your database:
          <ul>
<li>An <code>author</code> cert, indicating the person responsible for the changes
leading to the new revision.  Normally this defaults to your signing key
or the return value of the <code>get_author</code> hook; you may override this
by passing the <samp><span class="option">--author</span></samp> option to commit.  This is useful when
committing a patch on behalf of someone else, or when importing &ldquo;by
hand&rdquo; from another version control system. 
<li>A <code>branch</code> cert, indicating the branch the committed revision
belongs to. 
<li>A <code>date</code> cert, indicating when the new revision was created. 
Normally this defaults to the current time; you may override this by
passing the <samp><span class="option">--date</span></samp> option to commit.  This is useful when
importing &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; from another version control system. 
<li>A <code>changelog</code> cert, containing the &ldquo;log message&rdquo; for these
changes.  If you provided <var>logmsg</var> on the command line, this text
will be used, otherwise <samp><span class="command">commit</span></samp> will run the Lua hook
<code>edit_comment (</code><var>commentary</var><code>, </code><var>user_log_content</var><code>)</code>, which
typically invokes an external editor program, in which you can compose
and/or review your log message for the change. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn revert </span><var>pathname...</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-revert-_0040var_007bpathname_002e_002e_002e_007d-37"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn revert --missing </span><var>pathname...</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-revert-_002d_002dmissing-_0040var_007bpathname_002e_002e_002e_007d-38"></a><dd>This command changes your workspace, so that changes you have made
since the last checkout or update are discarded. The command is
restricted the set of files or directories given as arguments.  To
revert the entire workspace, use <samp><span class="command">revert</span></samp> "." in the
top-level directory. Specifying "." in a subdirectory will restrict
<samp><span class="command">revert</span></samp> to files changed within the current subdirectory.

     <p>If the flag <samp><span class="option">--missing</span></samp> is given it reverts (ie, restores) any
files which monotone has listed in its manifest, but which have been
deleted from the workspace.  Only missing files matching the given
file or directory arguments are reverted.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn update</span></samp><a name="index-mtn-update-39"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn update --revision=</span><var>revision</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-update-_002d_002drevision_003d_0040var_007brevision_007d-40"></a><dd>Without a <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> argument, this command incorporates
&ldquo;recent&rdquo; changes found in your database into your workspace. It
does this by performing 3 separate stages. If any of these stages
fails, the update aborts, doing nothing. The stages are:

          <ul>
<li>Examine the ancestry graph of revisions in your database, and (subject
to trust evaluation) select the set of all descendents of your
workspace's base revision. Call this set the &ldquo;candidates&rdquo; of the
update. 
<li>Remove any candidates which lack acceptable testresult
certificates. From the remaining candidates, select the deepest child
by ancestry and call it the &ldquo;target&rdquo; of the update. 
<li>Merge the target of the update with the workspace, in memory, and
if the merge is successful, write the result over top of the workspace. 
</ul>

     <p>With an explicit <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> argument, the command uses that revision
as the update target instead of finding an acceptable candidate.

     <p>The effect is always to take whatever changes you have made in the
workspace, and to &ldquo;transpose&rdquo; them onto a new revision, using
monotone's 3-way merge algorithm to achieve good results.  Note that
with the explicit <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> argument, it is possible to update
&ldquo;backwards&rdquo; or &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; in history &mdash; for example, reverting to
an earlier revision, or if your branch has two heads, updating to the
other.  In all cases, the end result will be whatever revision you
specified, with your local changes (and only your local changes)
applied.

     <p>If a <samp><span class="option">--branch</span></samp> option is specified, the <samp><span class="command">update</span></samp> command
tries to select the revision to update to from this branch.  The branch
becomes the new default branch of the workspace (even if you also
specify an explicit <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> argument).

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn pluck --revision=</span><var>to</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-pluck-_002d_002drevision_003d_0040var_007bto_007d-41"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn pluck --revision=</span><var>from</var><span class="command"> --revision=</span><var>to</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-pluck-_002d_002drevision_003d_0040var_007bfrom_007d-_002d_002drevision_003d_0040var_007bto_007d-42"></a><dd>
This command takes changes made at any point in history, and attempts to
edit your current workspace to include those changes.  The end result is
identical to running <samp><span class="command">mtn diff <samp>-r</samp> </span><var>from</var><span class="command">
<samp>-r</samp> </span><var>to</var><span class="command"> | patch <samp>-p0</samp></span></samp>, except that this command
uses monotone's merger, and thus intelligently handles renames,
conflicts, and so on.

     <p>If only one revision is given, applies the changes made in <var>to</var> as
compared with <var>to</var>'s parent.  If two revisions are given, applies
the changes made to get from <var>from</var> to <var>to</var>.

     <p>Note that this is not a true cherrypick operation.  A true cherrypick,
as that word is used in version control theory, involves applying some
changes out of context, and then recording the identity between the
original changes and the newly applied changes for the use of later
merges.  This command does the first part, not the second.  As far as
monotone is concerned, the changes made by <samp><span class="command">mtn pluck</span></samp> are
exactly like those made in an editor; the command is simply a
convenient way to make certain edits quickly.  In practice, this is
rarely a problem.  <samp><span class="command">mtn pluck</span></samp> should almost always be used
between branches that will never be merged &mdash; for instance,
backporting fixes from a development branch to a stable branch.

     <p>When you use <samp><span class="command">pluck</span></samp> you are going behind monotone's back, and
reducing its ability to help you keep track of what has happened in
your history.  Never use <samp><span class="command">pluck</span></samp> where a true merging command
like <samp><span class="command">merge</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">propagate</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">explicit_merge</span></samp>
will do.  If you find yourself using <samp><span class="command">pluck</span></samp> often, you should
consider carefully whether there is any way to change your workflow to
reduce your need for <samp><span class="command">pluck</span></samp>ing.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn refresh_inodeprints</span></samp><a name="index-mtn-refresh_005finodeprints-43"></a><dd>This command puts the current workspace into <a href="Inodeprints.html#Inodeprints">Inodeprints</a> mode,
if it was not already, and forces a full inodeprints cache refresh. 
After running this command, you are guaranteed that your workspace is
in inodeprints mode, and that the inodeprints cache is accurate and up
to date.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn pivot_root [--execute] pivot_root </span><var>new_root</var> <var>put_old</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-pivot_005froot-_005b_002d_002dexecute_005d-pivot_005froot-_0040var_007bnew_005froot_007d-_0040var_007bput_005fold_007d-44"></a><dd>Most users will never need this command.  It is primarily useful in
certain tricky cases where one wishes to combine several projects
into one, or split one project into several. See also <samp><span class="command">merge_into_dir</span></samp>.

     <p>Its effect is to rename the directory whose name is currently
<var>new_root</var> to become the root directory of the versioned tree, and
to at the same time rename the directory that is currently the root of
the versioned tree to have the name <var>put_old</var>.  Conceptually, it
is equivalent to executing the following commands in the root of the
workspace:

     <pre class="smallexample">          $ mtn rename . <var>new_root</var>/<var>put_old</var>
          $ mtn rename <var>new_root</var> .
     </pre>
     <p>Except, of course, that these <samp><span class="command">rename</span></samp> commands are illegal,
because after the first command the tree has no root at all, and there
is a directory loop.  This illegality is the only reason for
<samp><span class="command">pivot_root</span></samp>'s existence; internally, the result is treated
exactly like two renames, including with respect to merges and
updates.

     <p>The use of <samp><span class="option">--execute</span></samp> with this command is strongly
recommended, though not required.
