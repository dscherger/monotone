This command prints a description of the &ldquo;status&rdquo; of your workspace. 
In particular, it prints:
          <ul>
<li>The branch currently selected in <samp><span class="file">_MTN/options</span></samp> for the
workspace. 
<li>The revision id of the &ldquo;parent&rdquo; revision of the workspace, on which
your in-progress changes are based. 
<li>A list of logical changes between the base and current manifest
versions, such as adds, drops, renames, and patches. 
</ul>

     <p>Specifying optional <var>pathname...</var> arguments to the <samp><span class="command">status</span></samp>
command restricts the set of changes that are visible and results in
only a partial status of the workspace. Changes to files not included
in the specified set of pathnames will be ignored.

     <p>From within a subdirectory of the workspace the <samp><span class="command">status</span></samp> command
will, by default, include <em>all changes</em> in the workspace. 
Specifying only the pathname "." will restrict <samp><span class="command">status</span></samp> to files
changed within the current subdirectory of the workspace.

This command prints out a log, in forward ancestry order by default
but optionally in reverse ancestry order, of small history summaries. 
Each summary contains author, date, branch, changelog and comment
information associated with a revision.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--brief</span></samp> is given, the output consists of two lines per
revision with the revision ID, the author, the date and the branches
(separated with commas). If the <samp><span class="option">--no-graph</span></samp> option is also
given the output contains only one line per revision.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--last=</span></samp><var>n</var> is given, at most <var>n</var> log entries will
be given and log will trace through history in reverse-ancestry order,
from newer revisions to older revisions.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--next=</span></samp><var>n</var> is given, at most <var>n</var> log entries will
be given and log will trace through history in forward-ancestry order,
from older revisions to newer revisions. This is useful to review
changes that will be applied to the workspace when <samp><span class="command">update</span></samp> is
run.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--from=</span></samp><var>id</var> is given, log starts tracing through
history from the specified revisions, otherwise it starts from the
base revision of your workspace. Log will stop when it reaches the end
of the revision history or revisions specified by the <samp><span class="option">--to</span></samp>
option.

     <p>When tracing through history in reverse-ancestry order and
<samp><span class="option">--to=</span></samp><var>id</var> is given, log will stop when it reaches the
specified revisions or any of their ancestors or the end of the
revision history. When tracing through history in forward-ancestry
order log will stop when it reaches the specified revisions or any of
their descendants or the end of the revision history.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--revision=</span></samp><var>id</var> is given, log will print only the
specified revisions.

     <p>If both <samp><span class="option">--from</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> are given only
revisions included by both options will be logged. Revisions specified
by <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> that are beyond the starting points specified
by <samp><span class="option">--from</span></samp> will be excluded.

     <p>Additionally, each of the <samp><span class="option">--from</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--to</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> options accept selectors, see
<a href="Selectors.html#Selectors">Selectors</a>. These can be used in various ways to log interesting
revisions.  For example:
<pre class="verbatim">     
     $ mtn log --revision b:
     $ mtn log --revision today
     $ mtn log --revision bob
</pre>
will log all revisions from the current branch, all revisions dated
today and all revisions with bob as the author, respectively.

     <p>By default, the log entries for merge nodes are shown.  If
<samp><span class="option">--no-merges</span></samp> is given, the log entries for these nodes will be
excluded.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--no-files</span></samp> is given, the log output excludes the list of
files changed in each revision.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--no-graph</span></samp> is given, the log output excludes the ASCII revision graph
prefix on log output lines.

     <p>Specifying <samp><span class="option">--diffs</span></samp> causes the log output to include a unified
diff of the changes in each revision.

     <p>If one or more files are given, the command will only log the revisions
where those files are changed.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn annotate </span><var>file</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-annotate-_0040var_007bfile_007d-70"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn annotate [--revision=</span><var>id</var><span class="command">] [--revs-only] </span><var>file</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-annotate-_005b_002d_002drevision_003d_0040var_007bid_007d_005d-_005b_002d_002drevs_002donly_005d-_0040var_007bfile_007d-71"></a><dd>
Dumps an annotated copy of the file to stdout. The output is in the form
&lt;short revision id&gt;.. by &lt;author&gt; &lt;date&gt;: &lt;line&gt; Only the first 8
characters of the revision id are displayed, the author cert value is
truncated at the first <code>@</code> or space character and the date field
is truncated to remove the time of day.

     <p>If <samp><span class="option">--revs-only</span></samp> is specified, each line of the file is
translated to &lt;revision id&gt;: &lt;line&gt; in the output, where &lt;revision id&gt;
is the revision in which that line of the file was last edited.

     <br><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn complete file </span><var>partial-id</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-complete-file-_0040var_007bpartial_002did_007d-72"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn complete [--brief] key </span><var>partial-id</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-complete-_005b_002d_002dbrief_005d-key-_0040var_007bpartial_002did_007d-73"></a><dt><samp><span class="command">mtn complete [--brief] revision </span><var>partial-id</var></samp><a name="index-mtn-complete-_005b_002d_002dbrief_005d-revision-_0040var_007bpartial_002did_007d-74"></a><dd>
These commands print out all known completions of a partial <span class="sc">sha1</span>
value, listing completions which are <code>file</code>, <code>manifest</code> or
<code>revision</code> IDs depending on which variant is used. For
example, suppose you enter this command and get this result:

     <pre class="smallexample">          $ mtn complete revision fa36
          fa36deead87811b0e15208da2853c39d2f6ebe90
          fa36b76dd0139177b28b379fe1d56b22342e5306
          fa36965ec190bee14c5afcac235f1b8e2239bb2a
     </pre>
     <p>Then monotone is telling you that there are 3 revisions it knows
about, in its database, which begin with the 4 hex digits
<code>fa36</code>. This command is intended to be used by programmable
completion systems, such as those in <samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">zsh</span></samp>.

     <p>The complete command for keys and revisions have a <samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> option. 
Programmable completion systems can use <samp><span class="option">--verbose</span></samp> output to
present users with additional information about each completion option.

     <p>For example, verbose output for <code>revision</code> looks like this:
     <pre class="smallexample">          $ mtn complete revision 01f
          01f5da490941bee1f0000f0561fc62eabfb2fa23 graydon@dub.net 2003-12-03T03:14:35

These commands print out GNU &ldquo;unified diff format&rdquo; textual difference
listings between various manifest versions. With no <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp>
options, <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> will print the difference from the
base revision to the current revision in the workspace.

     <p>With one <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> option, <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> will print the
difference from the revision <var>id</var> to the current revision in the
workspace. If <samp><span class="option">--reverse</span></samp> is given, the order of the diff is
reversed.

     <p>With two <samp><span class="option">--revision</span></samp> options <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> will print the
difference from revision <var>id1</var> to <var>id2</var>, ignoring any
workspace.

     <p>In all cases, monotone will print a textual summary &ndash; identical to
the summary presented by <samp><span class="command">mtn status</span></samp> &ndash; of the logical
differences between revisions in lines proceeding the diff. These
lines begin with a single hash mark <code>#</code>, and should be ignored by
a program processing the diff, such as <samp><span class="command">patch</span></samp>.

     <p>Specifying pathnames to the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> command restricts the set of
changes that are visible and results in only a partial diff between
two revisions. Changes to files not included in the specified set of
pathnames will be ignored.

     <p>From within a subdirectory of the workspace the <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> command
will, by default, include <em>all changes</em> in the workspace. 
Specifying only the pathname "." will restrict <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> to files
changed within the current subdirectory of the workspace.

     <p>The output format of <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> is controlled by the options
<samp><span class="option">--unified</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--context</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">--no-show-encloser</span></samp>, and
<samp><span class="option">--external</span></samp>.  By default, monotone uses its built-in diff
algorithm to produce a listing in &ldquo;unified diff&rdquo; format (analogous
to running the program <samp><span class="command">diff <samp>-u</samp></span></samp>); you can also explicitly
request this with <samp><span class="option">--unified</span></samp>.  The built-in diff algorithm can
also produce &ldquo;context diff&rdquo; format (analogous to <samp><span class="command">diff <samp>-c</samp></span></samp>),
which you request by specifying <samp><span class="option">--context</span></samp>.  The short options
that <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> accepts for these modes, <samp><span class="option">-u</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp>, also work.

     <p>In either of these modes, monotone prints the name of the top-level code
construct that encloses each &ldquo;hunk&rdquo; of changes, unless suppressed with
the <samp><span class="option">--no-show-encloser</span></samp>.  The options that
<samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> accepts for this mode, <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">--show-c-function</span></samp>, also work.  Monotone finds the enclosing
construct by scanning backward from the first changed line in each
hunk for a line that matches a regular expression.  The default
regular expression is correct for many programming languages.  You can
adjust the expression used with the Lua hook
<code>get_encloser_pattern</code>; <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a>.  For the regular expression
syntax, See <a href="Regexps.html#Regexps">Regexps</a>.

     <p><samp><span class="option">--unified</span></samp> requests the &ldquo;unified diff&rdquo; format, the default. 
<samp><span class="option">--context</span></samp> requests the &ldquo;context diff&rdquo; format (analogous to
running the program <samp><span class="command">diff <samp>-c</samp></span></samp>).  Both of these formats are
generated directly by monotone, using its built-in diff algorithm.

     <p>Sometimes, you may want more flexibility in output formats; for these
cases, you can use <samp><span class="option">--external</span></samp>, which causes monotone to invoke
an external program to generate the actual output.  By default, the
external program is <code>diff</code>, and you can use the option
<samp><span class="option">--diff-args</span></samp> to pass additional arguments controlling
formatting.  The actual invocation of <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp>, default arguments
passed to it, and so on, are controlled by the hook
<code>external_diff</code>; see <a href="Hooks.html#Hooks">Hooks</a> for more details.

These commands will print out a list of certificates associated with
a particular revision <var>id</var>. Each line of the print out will
indicate:
          <ul>
<li>Whether the signature on the certificate is <code>ok</code> or <code>bad</code>
<li>The key used to sign the certificate
<li>The name of the certificate
<li>The value of the certificate
</ul>

     <p>For example, this command lists the certificates associated with a
particular version of monotone itself, in the monotone development
branch:
