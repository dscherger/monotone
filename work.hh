// this file defines structures to deal with the "workspace" of a tree
//

//
// workspace book-keeping files are stored in a directory called _MTN, off
// the root of the workspace source tree (analogous to the CVS or .svn
// directories). there is no hierarchy of _MTN directories; only one exists,
// and it is always at the root. it contains the following files:
//

// _MTN/revision     -- this file can be thought of as an approximation to the
//                      revision that would be added to the database if one
//                      were to execute 'mtn commit' with the current set of
//                      changes.  it records the id of the revision that was
//                      checked out (the "parent revision") plus a cset
//                      describing pathname and attribute modifications
//                      relative to that revision.  if the workspace is the
//                      result of a merge, the revision will have more than
//                      one parent and thus more than one cset.  files
//                      changed solely in content do not appear in
//                      _MTN/revision; this is the major difference between
//                      the revision in this file and the revision that 'mtn
//                      commit' adds to the database.
// _MTN/options      -- the database, branch and key options currently in use
// _MTN/log          -- user edited log file
// _MTN/inodeprints  -- file fingerprint cache, see below
//
// as work proceeds, the files in the workspace either change their
// sha1 fingerprints from those listed in the revision's manifest, or else are
// added or deleted or renamed (and the paths of those changes recorded in
// '_MTN/revision').
//
// many operations need to work with a revision that accurately describes
// both pathname and content changes.  constructing this revision is the
// function of update_current_roster_from_filesystem().  this operation
// intrinsically requires reading every file in the workspace, which can be
// slow.  _MTN/inodeprints, if present, is used to speed up this process; it
// records information accessible via stat() that is expected to change
// whenever a file is modified.  this expectation is not true under all
// conditions, but works in practice (it is, for instance, the same
// expectation used by "make").  nonetheless, this mode is off by default.
